Okay. Let's see where we are.
We could move this, get rid of that, kill that.
That kind of freaks me out. Don't need her. We can get rid of that.
That's done. Okay, we could start with this.
I know it's a hard-hitting piece, but come on, you guys, it's the Internet.
We need traffic, traffic, traffic. What do you got?
-How about this? -It's perfect.
Now, doesn't she look smart and knowledgeable about immigration reform?
-Yeah. -Yeah, yeah. She does, right?
I'm fucking with you people. This isn't a porn site. What are we, nerds trying to look at boobies?
Come on, keep looking.
Shit! Hello?
Hey! Baby, where are you? Are you still at work?
No! Not even close.
Just so you know, the movie starts in 10 minutes.
-I know! Give me your pants. -What?
-I'll buy you lunch tomorrow. Come on. -No.
I'm your boss. Give me your pants.
Please try not to be late. I really hate missing the beginning.
I know. I know.
Give me your pants. I'm coming, baby.
I'm almost there!
-How far away? -I think I see you!
-Where are you? I'm here. -So am I.
So many people. What are you wearing?
I'm wearing the only clothes outside the theater,
because I'm the only person outside the theater!
I love that outfit. You look so sexy in that.
You know that I love this movie.
If a prostitute and a ruthless businessman can fall in love,
then anyone can.
I know this means a lot to you, which means it means a lot to me.
Well, apparently it doesn't.
I'm looking at you right now. I can see you!
Jamie!
-Hey. -You made it.
-Sorry I'm late. -It's okay. I got us sandwiches.
I got you turkey, no cheese, gluten-free bread.
You sure this was prepared in a nut-free facility?
Yes, I'm fully aware of your allergies.
Hey, I'm here! I'm here. I'm really sorry.
We missed Your Body Is a Wonderland.
Okay. Only one song. That's not so bad, right?
It was fucking Your Body Is a Wonderland!
Well, the good news is, he has so many good ones.
Here's an idea: next time, instead of being late, just shit on my face.
'Cause that's kind of the same thing as missing Your Body Is a Wonderland.
Okay, come on. We really gotta go in.
Julia Roberts is about to put on her really tall boots.
We need to talk.
I think we should take a break.
I just feel like we should chill for a while, you know?
-You're doing this? -You're breaking up with me?
You said I was your soul mate.
I did? When?
When we were at that bed and breakfast having sex.
-But, you know, that doesn't... -That doesn't what?
-Count. -I was tied up at work. I'm sorry.
Maybe you should care a little bit less about work
and a little more about the girl that you're dating.
'Cause last time I checked, work doesn't reassure you
that liking a finger up your ass doesn't make you gay.
I never said "go up." Okay?
I just said lightly around... It's like a little button.
You know what? Not your issue anymore.
Is this why you were late?
You were worried about how to break up with me?
Oh, no, no. I was trying to decide what to wear.
-So, you went with sneakers and a hoodie. -Yeah.
What, are you gonna take the SATs after this?
Don't lash out, okay?
-You're better than that. -I'm really not.
I just think we're heading in different directions.
Yeah, you to the John Mayer concert and me not.
Thank you for doing this before the concert, by the way.
Best breakup ever.
He is the Sheryl Crow of our generation!
Let me just ask you a quick question.
And just know that I am not at all crushed by this breakup.
So, be honest. Why?
-Wait, is this a trick? -No.
Just pure anthropological research.
Okay. You want someone to sweep you off your feet,
but you're more interested in getting swept off your feet
than the someone who's doing the sweeping.
You seem like you've got it totally together,
but you're actually really emotionally damaged.
Also, you have, like, really big eyes, and that freaks me out sometimes...
Thank you. That's enough.
It is not you at all.
Of course it's me! You can't say that. You're breaking up with me!
It's not. It's me. I don't like you anymore.
This is my fault. You deserve better than me.
You're a great guy.
A little too emotionally unavailable, if you ask me.
I didn't.
I really want to stay friends.
-Let's stay friends. -Sure.
Totally.
John Mayer.
John fucking Mayer!
Come here, you.
You're gonna get through this.
Why do relationships always start off so fun and then turn into suck-a-bag-o-dicks?
I really have to stop buying into this bullshit Hollywood clich√© of true love.
Shut up, Katherine Heigl! You stupid liar!
I'm just gonna work and fuck. Like George Clooney.
I'm just gonna shut myself down emotionally.
Like George Clooney.
Hello.
Seat up, please, sir.
Is that the Hudson River?
No. It's the East River.
So we won't be landing on it, then, like that flight,
you know, with that captain they keep giving medals to?
That pilot was a hero.
Asshole.
Plane actually did a lot of the work.
I think I found the perfect guy to fill that job at GQ.
No, he's landing early. I'm scrambling.
No, he's not sold on the job yet, but I'll get him there. I always do.
I'm even picking him up in a hybrid.
He's from LA. I figured he's into all that bullshit.
Hey, sir, what's that tall building over there?
Empire State Building.
No, no, no, no. No. The other one.
The really, really tall one with the antenna on top of it, the windows.
That is Empire State Building.
Oh, yeah. You're right. King Kong.
Oh, hey! Are you done with this? All met up?
Great. Welcome to New York, Ms. Penderghast.
Oh, no. Excuse me. Sorry.
-Can you hand me my bag? -Sure. Which one?
-The one with the straps. -Okay.
There.
-Thank you. -Welcome to New York, sir.
-Excuse me. -Yeah.
That's me. Which one, the blue or the yellow?
No. The makeshift sign made out of lipstick, that's me.
-You're Dylan Harper. -I am.
I'm Jamie Rellis.
-You're picking me up from the airport. -Hi. Yes, I am.
You always pick people up like this?
Yeah, you know, I like to keep things interesting.
-Welcome to New York. -Thank you.
You're not exactly what comes to mind when you think headhunter.
Yeah, I prefer "executive recruiter." Headhunter sounds a little creepy.
You did stalk me for six months. Kind of creepy.
Here, here, here, I'll take it.
You're really gonna carry my bag? You're that girl?
No. I'm gonna change your life. I'm that girl.
My life is already pretty great.
Oh, really? 'Cause you wouldn't be here if your life were already pretty great.
A free trip to New York. I'd be an idiot to turn that down.
Well, then I guess you must have been an idiot for the past six months.
Yeah, a lot of people would say longer than that.
It's a huge opportunity, Dylan.
Art director of GQ magazine. This is the big leagues.
I mean, no offense to your little blog on the Internet.
Which got six million hits last month.
I could put up a video of me mixing cake batter with my boobs
and it will get eight million hits.
It's been done. Dunkin-My-Tits-Hynes.com.
Really?
Well, look, there's no question that you are talented at what you do,
but this is GQ.
New York's so crowded.
Look around. I'm from LA, okay?
-I like my open spaces. -What are you, a gazelle?
Come on, what's really worrying you about this?
I don't know. I don't want to be the guy who took something legendary
and shit the bed with it. Excuse the expression.
Well, then don't be the guy who shit the bed. Excuse the expression.
Be the guy who made the bed legendary again.
Listen, we'll get some coffee in you before the interview. You'll be fine.
I'm sorry, not coffee. Some green tea, soy, organic hemp bullshit.
Really hot in New York.
Doesn't it get hot in LA?
Yeah, it gets hot in LA, but it's the humidity.
In LA, if it's 90 degrees, it feels like 90 degrees. But...
-Right. -If it's hot in New York,
it's 90 degrees, it's like 100,000 degrees.
This conversation about weather is really fascinating,
but lucky for me, we are here.
So, good luck.
Whatever happens, happens. I told you, I don't really want it.
Just do me a favor? Act like you do so that I look good.
-I can do that. -Okay. Go get 'em.
This is great, by the way.
Watch it!
-Hey! -You're still here?
Yeah. Well, it's my job.
Nice.
So, tell me, how'd it go?
They bought it. You're safe for a little while longer.
Well, thank you. I owe you one.
This is from you. It's your offer.
-Wait, I got it? -They called about five minutes ago.
Congratulations. Offer expires at midnight.
Why didn't you just tell me instead of texting me?
'Cause it's more dramatic.
Dylan, you are not gonna shit the bed.
I've seen your work. It's amazing.
It's a huge move.
Would you uproot your entire life for a job? Be honest.
Well, no. For a job, probably not.
But for New York? Yeah, I would.
Which is why I'm not gonna try to sell you on the job,
I'm gonna sell you on New York.
It's New York!
I've seen Seinfeld.
Not the bullshit tourist version.
Puppy dog eyes. Nice touch.
Yes! Come on.
Let me buy you a drink.
What's wrong?
What are you waiting for?
The light to change.
You LA folk are so cute.
Come on.
Come on, it's fine.
-See? -Yep.
I'm gonna die.
Here we have Brooklyn Bridge, downtown Manhattan,
and right in front of us, an outdoor bar.
Alcohol. Now we're talking.
You know, I like you.
I'll give you your choice of closes.
-What? -How I close you on this job.
-Okay. -So we got the flattery close.
Dylan, you are so good at what you do.
The take-it-or-leave-it close.
Man, I don't care if you take it. I get paid regardless.
The sympathy close.
You see, my kidneys are failing...
Why do women think the only way to get a man to do what they want
is to manipulate him?
History. Personal experience. Romantic comedies.
Come on, you're here for a reason, whether you want to admit it or not.
Yeah, to explore an option. Who wouldn't want to know their options?
Someone who's in the perfect situation.
Are you in the perfect situation? Job? Absolutely.
Everything else? None of your business.
Shaun!
-Jamie! -Hey!
-Hey, what's up, baby? -What are you doing here?
-Shaun White? -You look great.
-You been working out? -Nope. Just been eating a lot.
-You want a drink? -Yeah!
-Let me get you a drink. Yeah? -Okay.
-Careful! Careful. -Sorry.
Hey, bro, that was like a double McTwist 1260.
-Yeah, like the trick. -Yeah, yeah, yeah. Dylan.
Jamie, you want to get this guy out of my face
before I break his fucking skull?
Sorry, bro. No disrespect. I'm a huge fan.
You don't fucking know me, man! Don't talk to me like you know me!
What, you think I'm all chill 'cause I snowboard and shit?
One more word, I'll fuck you up like dynamite!
Dynamite?
I'm just playing, bro.
Any friend of Jamie's is cool with me.
-It's all good, man. -All good.
I'm whispering in the ear of a dead man.
I'll see you later. -Good to see you. -Bye, honey.
Shaun White seems really great. Nice dude.
-How do you know him again? -I took his virginity.
So you guys have known each other for a while?
No, it was like eight months ago.
So does the carpet match the drapes?
It's hardwood floors, if you know what I mean.
My God! Terrible visual.
Totally kidding, by the way. Just an old friend of mine.
You guys use the same leave-in conditioner.
His hair had nice body.
Can I get two gyro number sixes, extra sauce?
-What are you looking for? -The cops.
-Come on. -The cops? Yep.
Come on!
-Where are you taking me? -You'll see.
Well, here's your open space.
Run, gazelle. Run!
-Wow. This is unbelievable. -I know.
Okay, this was not on Seinfeld.
Come on, what's your dad think about all this?
About what?
Well, he must have an opinion. He used to write for the LA Times for 23 years.
Somebody did their homework.
I have this thing at work. It's called Google.
Come on, what's he think about the job?
Actually, I didn't ask him.
Well, then you must know what he'd say.
He'd tell me to go with my gut and that he'd be proud of me no matter what I did.
Sounds like a really great man.
Yeah, he is.
Hey, do you want to see something really cool?
I always want to see something really cool. What...
Come on.
Okay.
Only place in the city you can actually see the stars.
-It's pretty awesome. -I know.
I like to come up here to think.
Just when it gets a little too much for me down there, it's like...
It's like my New York version of a mountaintop.
Best part, no cell reception.
You take all your recruits up here?
Actually, never really taken anyone up here.
-Really? -Yeah.
Thanks.
If you tell anyone about this, I will rip your ears off and staple them to your neck.
Everyone in this city seems really violent.
Come on, let's go. One last stop.
-We're just getting comfortable. -I know you are. Come on, buddy.
It's New York. Now hustle. Come on.
-Come on, come on. -You're showing me Times Square.
-This is not touristy at all! -Would you shush? Come on.
Do we have to power-walk everywhere we go?
Yes.
So everybody just kind of walks wherever they want, then.
How 'bout right here?
-What do you mean? -We're here.
Oh, my God, it's 1988.
All right, smartass, give it five seconds.
-What is this? -It's a flash mob.
-Like on Oprah! -Exactly.
Should we get out of the way? No, no. Enjoy it. Take it all in.
-It's pretty damn cool. -Right?
It's kind of rad.
Do these people get paid for this?
No. No. They kind of just do it for fun.
It's nice to feel like you're a part of something.
New York can be a little bit lonely at times.
And you're trying to sell me on it.
Every place can be a bit lonely sometimes.
-Be careful! -Oh, my God.
-Come down. -Okay.
-Shit. Get back down. -Okay.
-I'm in. -What?
-You sold me. -Really?
-I'll take the job. -Oh, my God!
-What, are you surprised? -No! No. Oh, you are gonna crush it!
Amazing.
-You can all go home now! Thank you! -Very funny.
Come on.
Congratulations, sell-out!
Thank you, thank you.
All I'm saying is, it wasn't so much the pilot's skill
that landed that plane on the river as much as the mechanics of the aircraft.
Are you saying that Captain Sully wasn't a hero?
No, no.
There were just other factors.
Are you not an American?
Hey, fuckface, you want to get your shit out of my car or what?
Welcome to New York. Go and fuck a dick.
Fuck.
So, all I ask is that you give me a little bit of time to gain your trust.
I know that I'm new at this, but what I lack in experience I make up for in clich√©s.
So, my door is always open.
But seriously, my door is always open.
My first order of business, lighter doors.
-Okay. Thanks, guys. -Welcome, Dylan.
Hey, man. Tommy Bollinger, sports editor.
Tommy, I've read your articles. Love your writing.
Just trying to keep it realsies.
Listen, I'd love to take you out one night and troll for cock.
-What? -You got some pretty boys out there in LA,
but the quality in this town is ridiculous.
We can tear this shit up.
I'm not gay, Tommy.
Really? I just assumed, art director and, you know...
Hey. No skin, more pipe for me.
By the way, doing a piece on racism in hockey.
Love to get your concepts on the font.
I'm thinking Helvetica but I could be persuaded to Courier New.
But what the fuck do I know? I'm just the sports editor.
-You sure you're not gay? -Yep.
-I'm sure. -Okay.
All right.
I'd knock, but you don't have a door.
-I don't. -No.
Hey, check this out.
Dunkin-My-Tits-Hynes.com.
-Yeah, it really does exist. -I told you, but not that. This.
Awesome.
But it'd be even more awesome if this happened.
Wait for it.
Nice!
I got in touch with a guy who puts flash mobs together.
We're thinking about using them for guerrilla advertising.
Taking something so pure and commercializing it?
Knew I found the right guy.
-Here I am. -Okay. Here's your contract.
Sign it and I will be out of here.
Okay.
A whole year?
Why do I get the feeling this is the first real commitment you've ever made?
It's not. T-Mobile, two years.
And, fuck, do I regret that one.
Do me a favor. Don't quit or get fired before the year's up,
because otherwise I don't get my bonus.
Wait, I can leave whenever I want?
-What's the point of this contract? -Just sign the damn thing.
Okay.
Nice doing business with you, Dylan Harper.
Hey, I was thinking of getting some lunch. Do you know a place?
Are you asking me out?
Whoa, I'm not asking you out.
I'm asking you to show me a restaurant.
I mean, I'm the only friend you have in New York.
-You don't wanna complicate that. -I know. I'm not asking you out.
I mean, sure, we'd have fun, roll around, -get into some erotic humiliation fantasy. -Erotic?
But it'd all blow up in our faces, end badly, and we'd never speak to each other again.
I'm not fucking asking you out! I swear to God!
Okay. You don't like me like that.
You don't have to be so mean about it.
I'm sorry. I didn't...
God, you're such a girl. Come on, it's my treat.
So was it an easy move?
-It was tough leaving my dad. -Yeah.
My sister gave me some shit.
But timing was right.
Timing was really right.
-Is that your sister? -No. My ex.
She's great. Loves John Mayer.
Wants us to stay friends.
She's also convinced she can cure me of my emotional unavailability.
-You're emotionally unavailable? -Oh, yeah.
Oh, my God. I'm emotionally damaged. I haven't seen you at the meetings.
I'm done with the relationship thing.
Girl, you are preaching to the congregation.
-Choir. -What?
"Preaching to the choir." You're supposed to preach to the congregation.
-That's the expression. -Did you understand what I was saying?
Then don't be a dick about it.
Oh, my God. Do you mind?
-Please. -Great.
Hello. You've reached Dylan Harper's cell phone.
He's emotionally unavailable, but if you'd like...
-John fucking Mayer! -Hello?
Wow. Hello? You really do have shitty cell service.
-Right? -Yeah.
I'm gonna have some friends over tomorrow.
Why don't you come, and you can meet some new people?
I'm gonna have to check my schedule. I'm really busy.
I work at GQ now. It's not some little blog on the Internet.
-You made it. -Sorry I'm late.
No, no. Please, come in, come in. Thank you.
Hey, everybody! Hey!
This here is Dylan. He's from LA.
He's the reason I can afford all this beer.
Okay, all right.
Am I an animal?
Yeah.
Fuck, I'm pretty good at this.
Lieutenant Kali's a West Coast street artist I got into about five years ago.
-His postmodern interpretation... -This shit is amazing.
I know, right?
You will be able to find the perfect candidate to fill the position at your company.
Okay, here we go.
First up is Joey Morena, who's fluent in Vietnamese
and has had 10 years of experience in the culinary field.
I can't do this anymore.
No, I think we both need to go get happy.
It's not adding up to a hundred anymore.
Looks like New York's all out of blueberries.
Goodbye, Flapjack.
Flapjack.
Why do all these movies have such bad music?
It's so that you know how to feel every single second.
"I'm heartbroken."
"I'm getting married to the man of my dreams."
"I'm sneaking through an office."
Madison, wait!
Madison!
Madison, wait!
Bryce.
How did you know I was at Grand Central Station?
You're not. You're in Los Angeles, where this movie was shot.
I know you better than you know yourself.
And your crazy friend Susie across the hall told me.
Susie.
Why are you here?
To tell you that
I love that sunsets make you cry,
and I don't care that you failed your real estate exam,
and I'm glad that you have a five-date rule.
And that I love you.
Not as much as I love you.
God, I wish my life was a movie sometimes.
You know, I'd never have to worry about my hair,
or having to go to the bathroom.
And then, when I'm at my lowest point,
some guy would chase me down the street, pour his heart out,
and we'd kiss.
Happily ever after.
I mean, a horse and carriage?
Come on, that is awesome.
Not as awesome as this ambiguously upbeat pop song
that has nothing to do with the plot
they put in at the end to try to convince you that you had a great time at this shitty movie.
You know, why don't they ever make a movie about what happens after the big kiss?
They do. It's called porn.
God, I miss sex.
Right? I mean, sometimes you just need it. It's like...
I don't know, it's like cracking your neck.
Why does it always gotta come with complications?
-And emotions. -And guilt.
Guilt.
-It's women's fault. -What?
You heard me. "Hold me. Let's spend the rest of our lives together."
Oh, please, you are no better.
"Oh, yeah, baby, come on, now. Say my name. Yeah...
"I'm done. How was I?"
Who have you been with?
Why can't it not be like that?
It's a physical act. Like playing tennis.
Two people should be able to have sex like they're playing tennis.
Yeah, I mean, no one wants to go away for the weekend
after they play tennis.
It's just a game. You shake hands, get on with your shit.
-Yeah. -Yeah.
Do you want more beer?
-Jamie! -Yeah?
-Let's play tennis. -What?
Let's have sex like we're playing tennis. Get the hell out of here.
Don't laugh. This could be great.
This could take all the weirdness out of it.
Well, we talked about this. I don't like you like that.
I don't like you like that either. That's why it's perfect.
I don't even know if I find you attractive. That's cute.
Well, I do have a thing for jerks.
Okay, well, do you even find me attractive? -That's cute. -No, no, no.
Before you got to know my awesome personality.
Strictly physical.
First time you saw me.
-This is just two people talking? -Yeah.
Two girls over drinks at Bennigan's. Go.
I liked your eyes. I didn't think I'd ever seen such big, beautiful eyes.
Your lips. Yeah. I thought you might be a good kisser.
I am.
-Your breasts. -What about them?
-They intrigued me. -Really? -Yeah. -I think they're so tiny.
-They're still breasts. -Thanks.
-I liked your hands. -Mouth.
-Butt. -Voice.
-Chest. -Eyes.
-You said that. -I meant it.
You swear you don't want anything more from me other than sex?
You swear you don't want anything more from me?
I know how you girls get. Tick-tock, tick-tock. Stop it.
-What are you doing? -I'm pulling up my Bible app.
-You have a Bible app? -Yes. I am a good girl.
-Hand on the iPad. -Okay.
Wait, no.
Why can't they figure this out?
No... This thing thinks I'm you and you're me.
Keep your hand still. I'll move the iPad.
-It's actually making me dizzy. -Hold on.
There we go.
No relationship.
No emotions.
Just sex.
Whatever happens, we stay friends.
-Swear. -Swear.
-Swear. -Swear.
Okay.
So I guess we should just start.
Okay.
I'll serve. That's really... That's enough of the tennis.
Let's go to the bedroom.
What's wrong with the couch? It's less emotional.
The bedroom has better light.
And since we're just friends, I don't have to be insecure about my body.
Come on, okay? You're beautiful.
You have nothing to be insecure about.
No, you see, that is way too emotionally supportive
and you need to just lock that down.
-Your ass is a little bony. -Much better.
My nipples are sensitive, I don't like dirty talk,
and had I known this was gonna happen, I would have shaved my legs this morning.
My chin is ticklish, I sneeze sometimes after I come,
and if I'd have known this was gonna happen,
I wouldn't have shaved my legs this morning.
Okie-dokie.
I keep my socks on. Intimacy issues.
Great, 'cause feet gross me out. Daddy issues.
Great.
I can work with that.
Should be fine.
I can't believe I'm doing this.
Should we stop? We could just go for a run.
I don't know, are we getting too old for this?
-Sex? -No, casual sex.
It just, I don't know, feels a little collegey.
-I could sing some Third Eye Blind. -Okay.
-That's not Third Eye Blind. -I'm pretty sure that's Third Eye Blind.
Nope.
-What's wrong? -We're just doing this once.
-I totally agree. -Okay.
-Great. -Great.
Little faster.
-More circular. -Watch my chin.
-Touch my ears. -Okay.
Kiss my neck.
-Say my name. -Dylan Francis Harper Jr.
Not my full name. Sorry, I had to fill out a lot of your paperwork.
-Stop talking. -Okay.
Oh, my God, you're really...
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P...
-Dylan, I... -Relax.
Just a friend going down on another friend.
Oh, yeah, baby. Tornado.
What, what?
What are you trying to do? Dig your way to China?
-I'm good at this. -Says who?
Every girl I've been with.
Well, they're either lying or their vaginas are made out of burlap.
So, relax. You're not a lizard.
-Okay, fine. -Okay, fine.
-A little to the right. -Okay.
-A little bit more to the left. -Roger that.
-Now go down. -Here we go.
-A little more... Whoa, too far! -Sorry.
-What's wrong? -Nothing!
When women start to scream, it could be misconstrued.
Just keep going!
Yeah, you know it.
Well, let me tell you how I like it.
See, most girls think you should start off soft,
but if you just get in, really go for it...
Yeah, you know it.
-Let's go with Obama. -No, no, no, no!
It's too easy, too predictable. Go with Shaun.
He's stylish, transcendent of sport, has an ass like a kumquat.
-I hear he's kind of a jerk. -No, he's not.
You're just threatened by him
because he's the greatest snow sport athlete in the universe
and he gets more squirrel than an oak tree.
Hey, Dylan? Jamie Rellis is in the lobby for you.
Okay, thanks.
Let's hit this after lunch. Okay, guys?
Nobody wants to fuck Obama, brah.
He's got ears like an elephant.
That's not the part of an elephant you want.
-Hi! -Hi.
Sorry to just show up like this.
No, no, no, it's fine.
So...
-Wanna take a walk? -Love to.
Great. Okay.
Okay, so about what happened, I...
-It was crazy and we shouldn't have done it. -Exactly. No, no, exactly.
I mean, it is so not me.
I totally agree. Let's forget it happened.
Great. I mean, look, I've had one-night stands.
We both have had one-night stands, none of which we're proud of, but...
Really?
Look, to think that you and I could just have sex
and without it compromising anything was just so...
-Misguided. -Exactly.
I was gonna call you this morning. But you didn't.
But I didn't.
And you see, it's already coming between us and I really...
I just don't want it to.
It's not going to.
Look, I know that I act all tough and I talk all tough, but really...
It's just a front to protect yourself from your own vulnerability.
What are you, my fucking therapist now?
No, I'm a friend. Who knows that every time you curse, you blink.
-Like your body's rejecting the word. -It does not.
-Fuck you. -Blinked.
-No, I didn't fucking blink. -Blinked again.
-Shit. -Ah, didn't blink.
"Shit" you're okay with.
-It was stupid. -Yes.
-We're friends, let's stay friends. -Yes. Yes, this, I don't wanna lose this.
Me neither.
-Great. -Fantastic.
Portrait for the lovely couple?
-What the hell are we doing? -I don't know.
-Rub my hair. -Kiss my neck.
-Watch my nipple. -All right, all right.
-I didn't know you had a tattoo. -Yeah.
Why didn't I notice that before? Because we were drunk.
-Was it your dog? -No. Never had one.
But everyone else did.
And I thought having a dog meant you had a normal family,
which at 17 I desperately wanted.
So as a sign of rebellion you got a tattoo
of the most conventional thing you could think of.
It was super awesome back then.
-Check it. -Okay.
-A lightning bolt? -Eighteen.
-Wanted superpowers. -Yeah.
I was a little into Harry Potter back then.
-Were you also gay back then? -Harry Potter doesn't make you gay!
-Okay. -Are you sure about this?
-Are you? -No.
Me neither.
-How was your day? -It was okay.
-I had a turkey sandwich for lunch. -How was that?
It wasn't that good. How was your day?
Still trying to figure out that subway system. It is tricky.
And it's out of here!
-My butt. -What?
-Oh, my butt. -Really?
No, I mean my butt, it's cramping. Can you grab a pillow?
Okay, yeah, yeah.
-So, no butt? -No.
-Really? Already? -Just kidding.
-Do you like this position? -Yeah, it's all right.
I gotta be honest, I feel a little emasculated.
A naked girl is lying on top of you and you feel emasculated?
-Little bit. -You do know what that word means, right?
Yes, I know what it means, and I feel it.
Okay, all right, you big baby.
-Chinese fire drill. -Okay. Go!
-Do you feel manly now? -I do.
Okay. Put it in.
That's not funny.
-It's kind of funny. -It's kind of funny.
-Hold on. -What's wrong?
I have to go to the bathroom.
-What? Now? -Yes, now. I had a lot of watermelon.
What's going on in there?
Do you know how hard it is to pee with a hard-on? No, actually.
It's like two lanes of traffic merging into one. It takes time.
-Are you pooping? -No.
-Why are you sitting down? -It's easier to control.
-You want a mess in here? -No. No, no. Sorry.
Yeah.
Yup.
What? Did I leak?
Did you wash your hands?
Oh, come on, dude. I know we're just friends, but I'm still a lady.
Now get back in there, wash your hands and then bring that fine ass back here.
If you keep talking to me like that, I'm not gonna come back.
-My hammies are killing me. -Have a banana, they're in the fridge.
Why would you keep bananas in the fridge?
-It dries them out. -It doesn't. They have a peel.
It's not armor. Air still gets in.
Do you want a banana or not? Not if they're dry. I'm not an animal.
At least I have food in the house. All you have at home is drinkable yogurt.
I like to drink my yogurt. It's a timesaver.
Well, then you think you could use that time to shave your stubble. Your whiskers are like knives.
Now, see, if you were my girlfriend, I couldn't tell you to shut up right now.
And because you're just my buddy, I can tell you
that if you don't start shaving up here, I'm gonna stop shaving down there.
-Mom! -"Mom"?
My eyes are covered. I don't know what you're doing.
I can't see you putting on your black underpants.
Jamie, baby, I missed you. Oh, baby.
Did your boobs get bigger? Mom, I'm over here.
Hey, baby. Oh, no, they didn't.
-What are you doing here? -Victor turned out to be a total Lombard.
L-O-M-B-A-R-D. "Lots Of Money But A Real Dullard."
Victor, her fianc√©. Ex-fianc√©.
-What happened? -Nothing. He was just blah. I mean, nice, but it was like talking to dirt.
I woke up one day and I said, "Lorna..." I'm Lorna.
-Dylan. -I said, "Lorna, this is not your bliss.
-"Just because you're 39..." -Forty-eight.
"...it doesn't mean you have to settle. He's not an insurance claim."
So I caught the first plane off the island.
-Cleveland's not an island. -Oh, baby, it is.
Anyway, here I am. It's so good to see you.
You never told me you had a hot boyfriend.
He's not my boyfriend, Mom.
-That's right, we're just friends. -I love it.
It's like the '70s in here.
That was a better time. Just sex.
A little grass, a little glue... Not during pregnancy.
Well, not during the final trimester.
But no complications. It's great!
Okay, well, that's technically, I guess, what this is.
That's exactly what this is.
So my daughter is just your slampiece?
No, no. "Slampiece"?
I'm just kidding. Slam away.
Have fun. I think this is great.
The only thing is, it takes you off the market.
But what the hell. The whole reason you go to the market
is to buy the produce, which you already got.
It's so good to see you, baby. I'm only gonna be here a few weeks.
I'm starving. You got any gin?
It's in the kitchen.
You gotta go.
-Is she wearing Axe body spray? -I don't know. Come on.
Bananas in the refrigerator? What are you, Puerto Rican?
-That is terrible, Mother. -Just joking. Your dad was Puerto Rican.
What? You said that he was Greek.
-Potato, potato... -Get your shoes.
-Okay. All right. -Well, not... Just go, just go.
I'll just put these on on the bike? -Yeah. -Okay.
It was nice to have met you...
-Hey. -And your pants are coming off.
Oh, my... Mom! Mom, please!
Back, back!
That's what I'm talking about!
We're kicking every gay ass out here!
I don't say that pejoratively, I say it hopefully.
Hold it. Any of you gay?
-Not even you? -Come on, man.
Come talk to me after. Give me five minutes of your time.
I might be able to let you see some reason.
Look at you in the house!
Come on, baby!
I'm supposed to meet up with Jamie.
Who's that, that headhunter?
What, you guys going out now?
No, no, no, we're just friends. We're messing around a little bit.
-What do you mean? -Sleeping together. But it's just sex.
That never works, bro.
She's a girl. Sex always means more to them even if they don't admit it.
Jamie's different.
Does she have a penis where most girls have a vagina?
-No penis. -Then she's no different.
What do you know about women, anyway?
Dude, I've turned down more tail than you'll ever have.
Yeah, bro. You're gay.
But the offers still keep rolling in, naturally. Look at me.
And, hey, I love women. They're beautiful, majestic, mysterious, mesmerizing creatures.
Smart, empathetic. Far superior to men in every way.
And if I had a choice, I would be with women to my dying day.
But me likes cock so I'm strict-aly dick-aly.
So it's always just about sex, then?
No. I've been in love. I went down that rabbit hole.
You know what I discovered?
It's not who you want to spend Friday night with,
it's who you want to spend all day Saturday with. Feel me, Felix?
Yeah, but then it's every Saturday for the rest of your life.
It's okay, you don't get it.
It's no big deal. But you will.
One day, you'll meet someone and it'll literally take your breath away.
Like you can't breathe. Like no oxygen to the lungs.
-Like a fish... -Yeah, I get it, Tommy.
Yeah, you don't.
Nice work on that new online site, by the way.
What was the font on that headline?
It was Times Roman.
Times Roman. Inspired. I'm out.
You have a boat?
I live in Jersey. And I ain't taking no ferry.
Unless it's out to dinner and a show.
You and that Dylan? Way to go. I mean the whole friendship-sex thing.
Kudos, baby, kudos.
It's not that big of a deal.
It's just surprising. I always thought you were a true-love kind of girl.
Whatever, Mom. It's not like it's stopping me from anything.
That's what I thought back in '78.
And every year since.
I'm just... I'm flattered, actually.
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
It's just surprising.
-There, done. It's... There we go. -Okay.
You look great! You look great. You look like a princess.
-Yeah! -Really?
-Yeah. -Okay.
Hey, my friend gave me his house in Montauk for July 4th.
Let's you and me go away together. No men, no bullshit.
Just mother-daughter. Like a Nora Ephron movie.
When was the last time we spent a full weekend together?
When I was eight, that time in Vermont. We got snowed in with the ski instructor.
-Demitri. -Bill.
He reminded me a lot of your father.
Dark curls, olive skin, Cold War accent.
-My father was Russian? -I don't remember.
But what I do remember is we drank a lot of vodka and shot a lot of guns.
Mom, this "who's your daddy" game is getting really old.
I know I haven't been the best mother in the world...
I'm sorry, were you waiting for me to jump in?
Come on! Go away with me. Come on!
Come on. Come on.
Okay, we'll do it. It'll be fun, yeah?
-Mom... -I was trying to bond!
It was either this or sniff glue.
-Sorry about my mom. -I thought she was funny.
Yeah, she's really funny when she's asking for money,
and she's hilarious when she needs a place to stay.
Dylan, I think I wanna start dating again.
Listen, I think we should stop this.
Yeah?
I kind of think you're right. Right?
Every new beginning comes from some other beginning's end
That actually makes sense right here.
Who would've thought Third Eye Blind could be so prophetic?
Not Third Eye Blind. I'm pretty sure that's Third Eye Blind.
Do you wanna go grab some lunch? -Yes. -Okay.
-You're buying. -What?
Okay.
-Pants. -Shirt.
So this is the end of this? -I guess so. But it's good. -Yeah.
-And we did it. -With no bullshit.
-Shirt. -Sweater.
We managed to actually stay friends.
-Yup. -Yeah.
Okay. So, what is your type, anyway?
No, I don't have a type.
-It's more about what's inside. -Oh, please!
Okay, what about her?
Yeah. I could get to know her inside.
And she's reading a book.
It's probably Nicholas Sparks.
-I'm gonna go talk to her. -What?
What do you mean, "What?" We said we wanted to date again.
-I'm gonna go talk to her. -Now?
Here, in front of all of these people?
I didn't say I was gonna rape her. I said I was gonna go talk to her.
Excuse me. I'm Dylan. Nice to meet you.
Nice meeting you.
-Well? -We talked. We laughed.
-She's Belgian. -Explains the reading.
I showed her where the balcony was,
because that's where she is meeting up with her husband.
Anniversary trip to New York.
Three kids. Christof, Karlina and Pepijn.
Shut up.
Why are you still laughing? At least I gave it a shot.
Fine. I'll go next.
-See if I still have game. -Okay.
-Yes. -Right here. Eleven o'clock.
-Iced coffee. -Handsome, but doesn't know it.
Staring at a tree, which means he's actually in the park for nature
and not to watch women sunbathe.
-Or he's retarded. -Don't care.
I'm going in.
-Excuse me. -Yes?
-Hi. -Hello.
I'm Jamie.
Yeah. Yeah, that works.
Hi.
Okay. -Nice to meet you. -Oh, my God!
Okay. His name is Parker. He's a children's oncologist.
And I have a date this Saturday.
-Nice. -Thank you.
Why'd you wave to me?
I told him you were my gay best friend,
so he wants to set you up with his brother.
College, med school, and I haven't slept since.
I can't believe you actually cure cancer.
Well, me and God.
-What? -I'm kidding.
Can you imagine someone who would actually say that?
Yeah, I could. I've been out with a lot of them.
-Cancer doctors? -No, assholes.
Well, hopefully you're all done with that.
Although, I gotta warn you, lot of cancer doctors, big assholes.
-Really? -Yeah.
And brain surgeons, huge perverts.
While they're doing this, a little bit of that.
Thank you.
When can I see you again?
Right now.
-I'm just kidding. -Okay.
Can you imagine someone who would actually say that?
I played the tuba in high school.
World's stupidest instrument.
Especially when you move eight times.
-Why'd you move? -My mom really likes to break up with guys,
and she was really good at it.
-Was your dad one of them? -No, no, he was long before that.
I actually never knew my dad.
I'm sorry. That sucks.
All right, look, I think I should probably tell you something.
Please don't tell me you're a dude.
Because that'll be like the third time since I moved here,
and I don't think I can handle that.
I have a five-date rule.
-You know, like, five dates before we... -Yeah.
I saw it in a movie. I thought I'd give it a try.
You're worth waiting for.
I'm sure that was the line in the movie you saw.
That's awesome.
This four-year-old that I've been working on for the last couple months,
he's gonna be fine.
-That's great. -Yeah.
How is a guy like you single?
I've just been waiting for someone to come up to me in the park
and compliment me for looking at the trees and not the sunbathers.
I meant it. It was impressive.
Actually, if I'm gonna be completely honest with you,
I was sleeping standing up.
I worked 36 hours straight. I don't even know how I got to the park.
How is a girl like you single?
I have issues.
One might even call me damaged.
Actually, one did call me damaged.
Get out of here. Damaged how?
I kind of believe in true love.
That there might be a Prince Charming out there for me.
Listen, I know this is probably a no because all you do is work like a dull boy,
but would you like to come get a beer?
I'm good.
No, it's not a gay bar.
And there'll be just as many hot girls as hot guys.
You know what? I will come out.
All right. Let's find you a lady.
You're still not gay, right?
-Nope. -Okay.
-What? -Do you know what today is?
-Date number five. -I wasn't even counting.
-Wanna go in the bedroom? -No. Here's fine.
I am so glad I met you tonight.
Me, too.
What are you thinking?
Just how great you are.
Annie, hey.
Who the fuck is Annie?
My sister.
Better be. I'll cut her.
Of course I'm coming.
Yeah, I'm taking the 4th off, so I'll be there for three days.
Yeah. How's Dad?
Any worse?
All right, tell him I said hi.
Bye, Banannie.
I want you to meet my parents.
No, you... Really?
God!
Hey. Hold on, hold on.
No, just hold on. Just give me a second.
I gotta go find a place to talk. Okay.
Shit. Shit. Just hold on.
-Oh, sorry. -Hold on.
I was out pretty late last night.
When I got in, you and your girlfriend were on the couch
so I just crashed in your bed.
-He's not a girl. -He smells like a girl.
-You smelled him? -I wanna buy marshmallows.
-What did you say? -For Montauk this weekend.
I wanna do a campfire, like when you were little.
Okay.
-And then we're gonna look for sticks. -I hear you. Sticks.
And then we're gonna sing. We're gonna...
Just hold on a second.
Okay.
Okay.
What's up?
Do you think guys care more about global warming
or how to wear white pants to a cookout?
Well, that depends.
Do you have a hot model in a bikini standing on an icecap?
No. Ski slope.
I'd still go with pants to a cookout.
Yeah, me, too.
How's your boy Parker? Still staring at trees?
Two coffees. Yeah, he's still looking up at trees,
but this time it's actually in my apartment.
-It's the fifth date already? -Maybe. Thank you.
Did you guys "fifth-date"?
-How dare you! A lady never tells. -I know. That's why I'm asking you.
Hey. I gotta go. You have a great trip in LA and call me when you land.
Okay.
Parker.
Hey.
I got us coffees. Nonfat, one sugar, one Splenda.
-I gotta get going. -What?
I thought you weren't on call today.
I'm not, but I got that thing... I got stuff.
This... They just called me.
-Really? -Yeah.
The sneak-out. How incredibly clich√© of you.
I don't think I can be your Prince Charming.
God, you totally didn't get anything that I was saying, did you?
-No, no, no. I think you're great. -Yeah, you, too.
Hey, you know what? You and I should stay friends.
-Really? -No, go fuck yourself.
Who sleeps standing up?
You know, you'd be really proud of me.
I didn't even blink when I told him to go fuck himself.
-You did just then, though. -This does not count. I'm not in the moment.
I don't know, maybe I suck in bed.
Trust me, you don't suck in bed.
-Thank you. -So needy.
Hey, maybe the guy's married or something.
No, did a background check at work.
Single, no criminal history, credit report 720.
Background check. Did you do one on me?
How could you possibly max out an Old Navy card?
After college I was really into cargo pants.
Dylan, I gotta stop thinking it's not me.
-I mean, it's gotta be me. -It's not you.
Nothing is wrong with you.
He's a guy. You gave him a five-date challenge,
he got you and cut out. Forget the douche.
He's a dick. He's a dick-douche.
Go have fun with your mom.
-Okay. -Almost forgot. I got you something.
It's Lieutenant Kali, the street artist we talked about.
I got him to do something for you. "F-tale." Fairytale.
-I know you're into that girly shit, so... -This is so cool.
Dylan, that's actually really sweet.
-It's cool, right? -Yeah. Thank you.
Hey, I'm gonna need to borrow cab fare.
I'm not taking that thing on the subway. I don't wanna get rolled.
No problem.
As long as you get your feet off my bed. They're disgusting.
What are you doing?
Why are you doing that? Why are you doing that?
You're an animal. Stop doing that. An animal. Stop.
Hey, Ma.
Ma. Come on, we gotta get on the road.
Come on.
Ma?
Why did I think that this time would be any different?
-Come with me to LA. -What?
What else are you gonna do? It's 4th of July, everybody's left the city.
You're very sweet for asking, but it's fine.
You know what, I'll just stay here. I'll be fine alone.
I know you'll be fine alone. You're not a baby in a hot car.
I'm actually asking you to come because it would help me.
You'd be a great distraction for my family.
They'd forget all about drilling me for being single.
Won't they think that we're together?
-Not if I tell them we're not. -And they'll believe you?
Yeah, we're one of these crazy families that doesn't lie to each other.
PBS is doing a documentary on us.
Come on, they'll love you.
All fast-talking and brusque, like I'm bringing home a carny.
You're really nice to ask, but I'm just gonna stay here.
Go to the gym.
I just got you a ticket with my miles, it's done. Meet me at JFK.
-But... -No buts.
-Like you were gonna go to the gym. -I wasn't.
LA's so nice.
And everyone's so genuine and level-headed.
Thanks for this. You're good peeps.
You're the good peeps, dude.
You haven't met my family. You don't know what you're in for.
Okay.
You know these planes pretty much land themselves?
Nobody cares. You sound like an asshole.
She's from New York.
I'm sorry.
Wow. This looks normal.
It is.
Thank you.
Wow, you grew up here?
It was my grandfather's.
He bought it when there was nothing else here.
My dad and my sister and her son live here now.
Why would you move to New York?
I was conned by some headhunter.
-You're here. -Sammy!
Hey, Uncle Dylan.
What's up, buddy?
How are you?
Jamie, this is my nephew, Sam the Magnificent.
-Hello. -May I offer you a light for your cigarette?
I'm sorry, I don't smoke.
Just pretend. He's a magician.
Of course I'll have a cigarette. Smoking is great for you.
-Wow. Thank you, good sir. -My pleasure, my lady.
Oh, my God. I got it, I got it.
Sammy. I got it, I got it. Just stay still. I got it, I got it.
Sammy! Are you okay?
All part of the illusion.
-Jet Skis later? -Definitely.
Still into magic, huh?
Yep. But I'll take that over him sexting his friends any day.
-Dilbert! -Banannie.
Jamie, this is my sister, Annie.
-Hi. -Thank you for having me.
Oh, please. It's nice to have Dylan bring a girl home.
-We're just friends. -Oh, no, I know.
If you were his girlfriend, he never would've brought you here.
-This one has intimacy issues. -I know.
-Dylan. -Dad.
-Dylan. Oh, man. -Hey.
-How you doing, buddy? -I'm good.
I miss you guys, but I'm good.
Dede Spencer?
Jamie. Dylan's friend.
-I'm sorry. I... -That's okay.
No, for a minute you reminded me of a girl I used to know.
-No, that's okay. It happens. -Nice to meet you.
Pleasure meeting you. You have a beautiful house.
Thank you.
Pool's a little cold, but it's very expensive to heat, so...
I think I'm gonna go in and check the tide tables
'cause I'm gonna take the boat out early in the morning.
-You should come. -I would love to.
We sold the boat.
The doctor doesn't want you driving the boat anymore.
-Turning to mush. -No.
It's good to see you, buddy.
-Nice to meet you. -It was nice meeting you, too.
-Jamie. See? -Yes.
-What's with the pants? -He doesn't like them anymore.
He's getting worse.
It's so good to have you here.
Go show her the beach.
-Let me show you the beach. Come on. -Okay.
-Go, get sandy. Get all messed up. -Okay.
Dylan never told me about your dad.
Yeah, it's been tough on him. They were real close.
Dylan doesn't quite know how to deal with the Alzheimer's.
I'm sorry.
He'll be his regular old self and everything seems fine,
and then just in a flash, he's gone.
-That's Dylan when he was nine. -Are those braids?
He was going through a Kris Kross phase. Remember them?
-Is that your mom? -No, that's Dylan's speech therapist.
He had a stutter. It got real bad when he was nervous.
He had a rough childhood.
-His math tutor called it "character-building." -Math tutor?
No, we're talking, like, 8 times 6 equals 1,200.
But he's very visual, thank God.
-Can you please explain to me this photo? -That is my 12th-birthday surprise party.
-Hey. -Amazing moment.
I'm exhausted. I'm gonna go to bed.
-Jamie, you all good with your room? -Yeah. No, it's perfect.
Thank you. Thank you for everything.
Sammy and I built a saw-a-girl-in-half box, so just be careful on your way to bed.
-He's not using a real saw, is he? -Of course he is. He's magnificent.
I'll make sure he brushes his teeth, and you, don't believe anything she says.
She's a liar.
-He's a pretty special guy. -Yeah, I think so.
-Jamie. Hey. -Hey.
-You up? -Yeah. Come in.
-I thought you were going to bed. -I was.
But then I realized we were both single again, so...
-Dude, no. -Why not?
I washed my hands. With soap this time.
Are you serious? Why would you just assume?
You cracked your neck on the porch. This thing. That's your tell, remember?
I cracked my neck because we were on a flight for six hours,
and you were yapping my ear off about how planes all fly themselves,
and it actually kinked my neck a bit.
-So, no? -No. Not having sex with you.
Is it your special time? They have an app for that. No, wait.
-Nope, you're good to go. -We talked about this.
-Plus, I just got dumped, so... -Okay, I'm sorry.
I thought this would be a good way to take your mind off him.
No, I don't function that way. Sex is not gonna help.
But you know what will? Emotional support.
Before we were sex without emotion, and now we're emotion without sex.
Exactly.
I just need you to be my friend right now.
Okay. So I'll listen to you while you give me a hand job.
-No. -I'm kidding. I got it. Good night.
Wait, hold on! Friends can still hang out and, I don't know, listen to music.
Listen to music?
I'm gonna kill Annie.
-I can't believe you used to like them. -I didn't like these guys.
I don't even remember...
And then there's something, I don't know what he says right there...
Are you kidding me? These dudes were da bomb.
Everybody had Girbauds, we all wore them backwards.
The baseball jerseys.
I went as Kris Kross three years in a row for Halloween.
-Oh, you poor kid. -I'm not proud of it.
Hey, I borrowed one of your books. I hope that's okay.
Like this.
No.
Surprise!
Have you really never brought a girl home before?
I brought you here.
I mean like a real girl. Not a friend.
-A real girl? -Yeah.
I guess not.
-Separation of church and state. -Ah, yes.
Build up as many walls as possible. That's really healthy.
-What, are you talking to me about walls? -Yeah.
What about you and your mom?
You couldn't get me out of there fast enough when she walked in on us.
That was for your own protection. Okay?
I'm just surprised she didn't try to slip you her number or something.
She did. She put it in my phone.
-Under "MILF." -Oh, my God.
It's cool, we only hooked up, like, twice.
I'm starting to get a mental image.
Well, I have a video image.
No. Just stop it. Just stop it.
Just wrong.
What?
Nothing. Just glad I met you.
Yeah, well, knowing you doesn't suck either.
-But I thought you said... -I know what I said.
God.
Lasorda was a good pitcher, but he was an even better manager.
-Wrecking Crew? -I wasn't saying he's not a great manager.
He's underappreciated as a pitcher, that's all I'm saying.
We get it. Guys.
-Hi. -Morning.
-Good morning. -Is it always this beautiful out here?
Well, in between the fires and the floods, we get about 10 good days.
No, no. Here. You two sit together.
-Are you sure? -Oh, yeah, no, no.
-You don't have to do that, Dad. -I know. I wanna look at the boat.
I love that boat.
-Here. Sorry. -Great. Thanks.
Here.
Thank you. This... Okay.
-Coffee, my lady? -Yes, please.
Thank you.
-All right, man! -Look at you!
-That's pretty impressive. -Yay, Sammy!
All right!
Oh, buddy. Your shirt's leaking. Oh, no, that's...
Apologies.
Here.
-You okay? -Yeah.
-You? -Yeah.
-See them, Sammy? -Yeah.
-Pretty cool, huh? -Yeah.
God, it's nice.
I do miss the mornings out here. Right before it burns off, it really is beautiful.
I like Jamie.
And she's pretty, too.
Hey, easy, dude. Don't you go casting a spell on her.
I'm a magician, not a wizard. You and your gay Harry Potter.
You can't deny that going to Hogwarts wouldn't be life-changing.
-I miss you. -I miss you, too, bud.
Mom misses you. And so does Grandpa.
Does he say anything?
No. But sometimes he calls me Dylan.
He said that he didn't want the job.
That he was just coming to New York to explore his options.
What a crock of gas.
You fly across the country to explore your options?
Please. I don't think so.
Exactly! Please, I knew I had him the second he got off that plane.
-Oh, did you, now? -Yeah.
Was that the same second you leapt onto the baggage carousel barefoot and acted out a scene from Will and Grace?
-She did? -Oh, yeah, you should have seen her.
"Look at me, I'm goofy but cute."
You know what? It was all part of my plan.
Quite a plan. Did you major in Planning at Headhunting College?
-So clever. -It's not a real college, by the way, buddy.
You guys bicker like you're an old married couple.
Here, pick a card, my lady.
Okay.
Oh, no, not that one. The one on top.
-This is a good one. -So...
-Yeah? -Shuffle.
Did you get her an engagement gift?
We're not engaged, Dad. We're not together. We're just friends.
All right, you don't wanna label it. I understand. But get her some jewelry.
The only thing your mom loves is jewelry.
I don't care how upset she is, I get her jewelry, she lights right up.
Where is she, anyway?
-She's not here, Dad. -I know, that's why I asked. Where is she?
-She's not coming. -Why not?
She doesn't live with you anymore, Pop. You're not married.
-What? -She left about 10 years ago.
I don't understand.
She divorced you, Dad.
-I have to call her. -Dad, you can't.
Stop telling me what to do.
Get your...
Dylan, get...
-You okay, Dad? -I'm fine, I'm fine.
-Here, let me help you up. -No, don't. Don't!
Here we are.
This is beautiful.
Yeah, this is where I used to come to think. My rooftop.
Okay, how high do you think that fence is?
I'm a little over 6 foot.
Looks like it's about three of me. So six times three...
Ninety-two feet.
-Ninety-two feet. That's really tall, right? -Yeah.
But they don't want you to get up there, so I guess that makes sense.
-Wait. Six times three... -Oh, God, you poor kid.
-What's up? -Come on.
What? What? Where are you going?
Jamie, no, no, no, no, no, wait. They take this shit seriously, okay?
Look at all the cameras.
This is the only landmark this city has other than the Scientology Center.
And if any of these cameras are hooked up to the actual Scientology Center,
that was an inappropriate joke and I apologize.
I believe in the freedom of science fiction.
Pussy! Oh, sorry.
Pussy!
Come on!
-You really never been up here before? -No.
I've also never transferred heroin in my rectum,
'cause it's against the law.
You know, sometimes a simple yes or no answer is adequate.
Hey, why didn't you tell me about your mom?
She's not worth talking about.
That's rough.
So is leaving your husband and kids.
Yeah, you never told me about him either.
You know, there's a lot of stuff you didn't tell me.
I don't want your pity.
I can handle anything except that look in people's eyes.
-That one. -Who cares what anybody thinks?
He's the smartest man I've ever known. He's the only person I'd ever go to for advice.
He's my dad.
Dylan, he's still the same man.
When I see the way people look at him now...
It doesn't matter how people look at him.
All that matters is how you look at him.
Yeah, but he's walking around without his pants. Everyone's staring.
-So what? -It's embarrassing.
He needs to know that nothing has changed.
That he's still that same man to you.
Can we stop talking about this?
Yeah, that's really smart. Let's just not talk about our feelings.
I'm trying not to.
Come on. Is something going on here? You've been acting really weird.
-No, I haven't. -Yeah, you have.
Is this about what happened the other night?
What, sex? That doesn't mean anything. You know that.
-And I haven't been acting weird. -Okay.
-Oh, my God! -Oh, shit!
-I told you! -Well, I'm sorry!
Fuck!
This is the LAPD. You are trespassing. Get down from the sign.
We gotta jump.
-Dylan, jump! -I'm frozen.
Come on, get down! Sir, this is your last warning.
-Use the ladder! -I have a fear of heights!
And also helicopters! They don't make sense to me!
What do you mean you have a fear of heights?
Why would you come up here?
You called me a pussy!
A bizarre situation this afternoon in the Southland.
The LAPD rescued a local man from the Hollywood sign,
the city's only real landmark.
They actually wrapped you in a foil blanket!
Did you run a marathon before this?
-Okay. Give me... -No!
-No, no. I wanna save it. I gotta save it. -No. That's enough! -Give me the remote! Shut up! -No, I wanna watch it over and over.
Foil wrapper...
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
It's okay, it'll be up on YouTube.
Hey, you're still good to take Dad that week I have to go to DC for Sam's class trip, right?
-Yeah, he's gonna stay with me in New York. -Oh, good.
So, when are we gonna see Jamie again?
I don't know.
What's your problem? Did you have a fight with your girlfriend?
She's not my girlfriend. Why don't you believe me?
I would believe you if you didn't lie to me.
I saw you creeping out of her room the other night.
Like you had just had sex, if you know what I mean.
Yes, I know what you mean, you just said it.
And how do you know what I look like after I have...
I'm not talking to you about this, okay? We're not together.
-Dylan. -Enough! I'm not talking about it.
Dylan.
Forgot my saw. I'll be right back.
I'll wait here. Don't worry about me.
Friends who have sex? What are you, in college?
-It doesn't matter, it's over. -Why?
Because we don't like each other like that.
Okay, you know what? Can we just talk about this? Sit down.
What more are you looking for?
-Who says I'm looking for anything? -Dylan.
-I don't know, but it's not Jamie. -Why, because you're great together?
Because you're actually friends with each other?
Because this is the happiest I have ever seen you?
I don't know what to tell you. She's not for me. I don't like her like that.
-You liked her enough to have sex with her. -It's just physical.
-Like playing tennis. -I don't even know what that means, Dylan.
I haven't seen you this dumb since you got that candy corn tattoo.
It's a lightning bolt! With extra powers!
Dylan, you can't name one thing that's wrong with her.
I can never go out with her. She's too fucked up.
Okay, she doesn't want a boyfriend.
She's too damaged.
Magnum P.I. couldn't solve the shit going on in her head.
Wow. You'll say anything right now
not to admit that you're perfect for each other.
-Why am I still having this conversation? -Because I'm right.
-Good talk, Annie. -Dylan.
I don't think the three-point line would have done anything.
-He was taller than anyone alive. -No, but it helped Kobe.
-Kobe Bryant is incredible. -It helped him.
-You're men. You like sports. You're men. -Scored 81 points. Please.
Hey! We were waiting for you.
I actually got a call from work.
I have to be on a red eye tonight back to New York.
-Tonight? -Yeah.
-Tomorrow's the 4th. -I know, it sucks.
Well, at least let me drive you to the airport.
No, no. It's fine. Stay. I already called a cab. It's out front.
But thank you guys for everything.
And thank you for letting me stay here. It's been pretty great.
-Everything okay, buddy? -Yeah, buddy. Everything's great.
I just really gotta go.
So, thank you again. I'm sorry I gotta go.
-Let Dylan drive you. -Yeah.
-Do you wanna take some food to go? -Do you want me to saw you in half?
You can send your bottom part to New York and your top half can stay here.
Or the whole of you could stay.
Okay, I'm sorry. I gotta go.
Jamie!
She's gone. She hopped in the cab.
-We should eat. You hungry, buddy? -Yeah.
Okay. Hand me your plate.
Hey, bro. You hungry? 'Cause I'm going to get something to eat.
Thanks, man. I think I'm just gonna work through lunch.
A work ethic. I love it. That is why this country is still number one.
Well, behind Germany and France and Belgium and Japan and China and...
Thank God for Bangladesh.
By the way, why did you take your door off its lovely hinges?
It was dumb, man. Something I saw in a management book.
Oh, right, right. Like, that's how Warren Buffett got rich.
He took doors off of things.
Hey, everybody wants a shortcut in life.
My guidebook is very simple. You wanna lose weight?
Stop eating, fatty.
You wanna make money?
Work your ass off, lazy.
You wanna be happy?
Find someone you like and never let him go.
Or her, if you're into that kind of creepy shit.
Hi, you've reached Jamie Rellis. I can't pick up the phone right now,
but please leave a message and I'll call you back.
Mom, Mom, you gotta point it at the screen. You gotta tell it where you are.
Fine. I'm over here pouring myself a drink.
Booty call. I can take a walk around the block.
No, no. Nope, that's okay.
This is your apartment. I don't wanna twat-block you.
That's Dylan, right?
-He seemed pretty great. -You met him once.
Well, that's more than anybody else you've dated.
I don't know, you think maybe I keep my worlds apart for some crazy reason?
I am an asshole.
We're looking for someone to lead the redesign of our entire website.
Someone to turn it completely upside down.
But you can't tell me what company you work for?
For confidentiality reasons, no.
Can you give me a hint?
We may or may not be the largest seller of purchased goods on the Internet.
And by "purchased goods," I mean books.
You just placed the new art director over at GQ, right?
Yeah.
That's the type of guy we want. Shoot, that's the guy we want.
Can you get him to come out to us?
No longer have a relationship with him.
-Can you get to him? -He's still in the first year of his contract,
so that would be inappropriate.
So is paying full price for a book at Barnes & Noble,
but people do dumb shit.
Hi, you've reached Jamie Rellis. I can't pick up the phone right now,
but please leave a message and I'll call you back.
Wow, right to voice mail. Didn't even ring.
Jamie.
How'd you know I was up here?
Only place in the city you don't get reception.
Right.
-Why are you avoiding me? -I'm not.
Really? Come on, Jamie.
Well, Dylan, I don't know if you've heard, but I am seriously fucked up.
I mean, Magnum P.I. couldn't solve the shit going on up here.
-Oh, my God, I'm sorry. -But I'm just gonna go
and try to fix the shit going on up in my head, if that's even possible.
I shouldn't have said that. I was just trying to get my sister off my back.
-She thought we liked each other. -Yeah, me, too, Dylan.
I thought we were friends.
But friends don't go talking shit about each other,
which must mean that you and I were actually never friends.
-That all you wanted was to get in my pants. -What?
You jumped at the chance at your dad's house.
You cracked your neck.
I thought you were giving me a sign. We talked about this.
Oh, my God, really?
You pulled my robe off. "Oopsy." Remember?
Yeah. And then you snuck out of the room. "Oopsy." Remember that?
Are you pissed off at me because I didn't cuddle?
Isn't that why we started this whole arrangement in the first place?
You wanted this.
I wanted this?
Just me?
God, you are just like every other guy.
The sad thing is, Dylan, I actually thought you were different.
Different from what? I'm not your boyfriend, I'm your friend.
Well, with friends like you, who needs friends?
And thank you for ruining my mountaintop.
Asshole.
Hey, man, you can't be up here.
Okay.
-You okay? -I'm fine.
Bryce, is this for me?
Yeah. And so is this.
Madison, will you marry me?
You bet your ass, Flapjack!
-I love New York. -I love you.
Oh, my God. Look, the Empire State Building.
Oh, look, the Statue of Liberty.
Hello, this is Jamie.
What do you mean they went to him directly?
Well, is he gonna take it?
No, no, no, no, no. I'll handle it. I'll call him right now.
Okay.
Hey, this is Dylan. Leave a message.
Excuse me. May I help you?
Oh, hi. Where's Dylan Harper?
He's at a photo shoot for the sports issue.
That's right. The photo shoot. Where was that again?
I'm sorry. Who are you?
One of the models.
I have the perfect body for Photoshop.
Yeah, this gets more angular, these get longer,
and this gets way more Christian.
So where did you say he was again?
Sports is the last chance we have of bringing our world together, bro.
So I just wanted to shoot some photos that speak to that,
to the unification of all people through sports.
Okay, guys. Let's go.
That's it.
Beautiful.
Okay, now put your arms around each other,
like you like each other, like you love each other.
-Too gay? -A little bit.
Throw some girls in there.
Come on, ladies. Hop to.
Girls, girls. Okay, look. Just blend in.
Okay, let's go boy, girl, boy...
-Dylan. -...boy, boy, boy, boys.
-What are you doing here? -You met for another job!
-What, are you gonna leave now? -I don't know. Yeah, I took one meeting.
-I can't believe you. -Come here.
-Is this your way of getting back at me? -What?
You know that if you leave before a year is up, I get screwed.
Oh, right.
If I did leave, which I don't know yet because all I did was take one meeting,
I'd write you a check for your bonus.
Whatever it is, I'll pay for it. Happy now? We good?
-Why didn't you tell me you were looking? -That's personal.
And we're not friends anymore. You made that pretty clear.
See, all I wanted to do was have sex with you. Remember?
Pretend you were the best friend I'd ever had.
Open up to you like I've never done with anyone ever.
And then when the sex stopped, invite you to LA for the weekend
to introduce you to my family.
-I'll send you a check if I take the job. -Don't bother.
Why don't you pick him up?
Yeah. Just pick him on up.
Oh, you little Christ figure, you!
-Hey, Dyl. -Dad's coming into Newark Airport, right?
Yeah, he leaves at 9:00 our time.
9:00. So it's a five-hour flight, three-hour time difference,
so he gets in at 32:00?
5:00. Be there at 5:00, Dylan.
Right. How is Dad?
He's lost more often than not now.
But then he has these moments of real clarity. It's hit or miss.
-Okay. -How's Jamie?
-That's over. -Oh, Dylan!
-Okay, we're done. -Don't be an idiot, please.
Thank you, Annie. I'll pick up Dad tomorrow at the airport.
-32:00 sharp. -I love you.
I don't know what it is.
I just can't get myself to start looking for a replacement for him,
assuming that he leaves.
-Do you want some motherly love advice? -Not really.
Oh, good, 'cause I don't know how to do that.
What I do know is that it's no great goddamn secret
you live in fear of repeating my mistakes.
And you're not wrong, so learn from me.
Do you know how many men in my life I thought were really perfect?
-Eighty. -One.
-Eighty-one? -One.
It was your dad. Greatest man I ever met.
Obviously. Look at you.
How smart you are, how great, how funny, how driven.
Your vaguely Middle Eastern beauty.
Sure as hell didn't all come from me.
Okay, but, seriously, Mom,
do you really not remember where my dad's from?
Or is it like a coping mechanism?
-A little of both. -Okay.
But I'm pretty sure he's Eurasian.
I mean, we all have our Prince Charming, you just gotta know him when you see him.
Mom, it's Prince Charming. You should just know.
Well, your Prince Charming isn't coming to rescue you in a horse and carriage.
That's not who you want.
I mean, you're looking for a man to be your partner.
To take on the world with.
You gotta update your fairytale, baby.
My Prince Charming?
You.
Mom.
-Hey. -A wheelchair. Like I'm an invalid.
-How was the flight? -I'm hungry.
You know they don't serve food in coach anymore?
You'd think with these new planes, they practically fly themselves,
they could get rid of a pilot and use his salary for a hot lunch.
-I know, right? Let's get you some food. -God.
The engineering on these planes is so advanced.
Completely computerized.
-It's like playing a video game. -Exactly.
God. How long have we been waiting here? It's ridiculous.
I'll be right back, okay?
Excuse me. We've been waiting a while.
-Harper. -Yeah, I got you. I got you.
I have to seat people in the order they came.
I totally understand that, but I'm with my dad
-and he's not in the best shape. -I'm sorry.
Is there no way we could, like, squeeze a table?
No, I gotta go by the list. Sorry.
Dad?
Dad?
Shit. Dad?
You gonna join me?
Absolutely.
Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry, you cannot do this.
Could I get a steak, medium, please?
-Sir, this is the Daily Grill. -Make that two.
Dede? Dede!
Dad.
Dad.
Who is Dede?
Jesus. She's just a girl that I met in the Navy.
She was the love of my life.
Okay?
Why didn't you tell me about her before?
This is not something you discuss with your children.
And besides, I have you and Annie. I have no regrets.
So tell me now.
She was the love of my life.
And I was too stupid to realize it,
and I lost her because of something so dumb I don't even remember.
And I never really got over her.
And I think that may be one of the reasons your mom left.
You know, my friends used to say that when Dede and I looked at each other,
it was electric.
And I let her go.
I just let her go.
Because I was too damn proud to tell her how I really felt about her.
I'll tell you something that I wish I knew when I was your age.
And I know you've heard a million times, "life is short."
But let me tell you something, what this is teaching me
is that life is goddamn short and you can't waste a minute of it.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
The girl I brought home to LA, Jamie?
-Yeah, what's going on with her? -I think I messed it up.
-Fix it. -She won't talk to me.
Maybe she'll listen. There's always a way.
If you think there's even a chance that she could be it, you fix it.
Did Annie put you up to this? Who's Annie?
I'm kidding. What, I can't joke about this?
-Jesus Christ, Dad. -I don't know what else to do.
Let's go.
You don't want to finish your steak?
We're eating in the goddamn airport. I can leave the steak. Come on.
Yeah, hey, this is Dylan Harper from GQ. We met a few weeks ago at the...
Right. Hey, can I ask you a huge favor?
-I am so sorry, sir. -It's my fault.
-You just scared me. -No, no. My fault. You all right?
-Yeah, I'm good. -Here, let me help you with that.
-Thanks, man. You're really nice. -All right. Hey, safe travels.
-All right, thanks, man. -Okay, thank you.
You gotta be fucking kidding me. All right, let's dance, Clowny Brown.
-What's your problem with me? -I saw you at that bar with Jamie.
How could such an awesome girl be with this over this?
I've been trying to take that little monkey to pound-town for years.
-I'll tell her you say hello. -What?
You missed a little. There you go.
Dylan! I got a cab. Come on.
I ever run into you again,
I'll crush your earlobes and make soup stock out of them.
-You have a vivid imagination. -I do!
-I'm gonna get in the cab now. -I'm gonna go make soup!
-What's the matter with her? -I don't know.
God! I thought LA was bad. This traffic is terrible.
Is there another way into the city?
I owe you big time, Tommy.
You'll make it up to me. Actually, I was heading into town anyway.
Tonight's the Butterfly Ball. Great place to pick up dudes.
-You okay, Dad? -Are you kidding?
1937 Chris-Craft? Couldn't get any better, buddy.
Nice.
Yeah. Hi, this is Dylan. We met at...
Right. Can I ask you a huge favor?
My number. Here's the remote.
My friend Dave from across the hall, his oven broke, so he'll be using the kitchen.
Your friend Dave is here using the kitchen or watching me?
Go.
-Holy... -What?
"How to wear white pants to a cookout."
Did you scoop the Times on this? I smell Pulitzer.
All right, all right.
Just say hello to her for me, will you?
See you, Dad.
Thanks, man.
Hi, Dave from across the hall.
Hi, Mr. Harper. How are you?
And now we know why you're here.
Mom, I'm over by the Lexington exit. Where are you?
I'm standing right by the guy in the tie.
-There are a million guys in ties. -So look for the guy I'm standing next to.
You never do what you say you're gonna do. When am I gonna learn?
Just hang on, baby.
What?
I don't think I'm gonna be able to make it after all.
Something came up. Let's meet tomorrow.
I'll be on the stairs. Right across from you.
Oh, my God.
Have a great night, baby.
What is this?
It's Closing Time, by the band Semisonic!
It's not Third Eye Blind. Can you believe that?
No, no, no. Not the song. This.
You said you wanted your life to be like a movie.
Sorry I had to use the real Grand Central instead of the fake one.
Listen, Jamie, I'm...
I'm having trouble hearing you!
Yeah, I didn't really think this through.
I guess in the movies the guy pours his heart out
and they put the music in later.
What?
I messed up.
I was scared.
Look at what happened with my mom and my dad.
Of course I was scared.
So I ruined it.
Everything that happens in the day,
all I can think to myself is, "I can't wait to tell Jamie about this."
When I see someone cursing, all I picture is you blinking.
And when I hear a kid's been cured of cancer, I pray it's not by that douchebag,
tree-hugging fucking doctor who ran out on you.
I mean, cancer being cured is awesome, but, you know, I wish someone else did it.
Come on.
Hey, I miss you.
Yeah, I miss you, too.
But you're not wrong, I am damaged.
So am I. Who isn't?
That's what makes us so awesome.
-And our tattoos. -Yeah.
-No, no, no. -Shut up. It's not what you think.
Jamie, will you be my best friend again?
-That is so lame. -I know.
That's some Prince Charming shit, though, right?
-Get up. -Okay.
Look, I can live without ever having sex with you again.
It'd be really hard.
Hey, I want my best friend back,
because I'm in love with her.
-Under one condition. -Anything.
Kiss me.
-In public? In front of all these people? -I did not ask you to...
You can all go home now.
Okay. So...
-What do we do now? -Have our first date.
Okay.
Oh, my God! Did you get a horse and carriage?
Yeah, that's not for you.
Oh, thank God. Horses actually scare the shit out of me.
-Really? -Yeah.
So, where are you from?
-Outside of Philly, actually. -Interesting.
-I'm from LA, just moved to New York. -Interesting. Didn't really ask, but go on.
What? I'm excited, I'm on a first date. So...
This isn't weird at all.
-We're okay. -Yeah. Thank you.
So...
Yeah, fuck it.
Roll credits, roll credits, roll credits. And here come the outtakes.
Because if the actors had a good time making it, it must be good.
You bet your ass, Jason.
Oh, my God, I just called him Jason.
Look, the crew's laughing.
They made me do it! They made me do it.
It's my favorite part.

THERE'S NOTHING TO TELL.
IT'S JUST SOME GUY I WORK WITH.
COME ON. YOU'RE GOING OUT WITH THE GUY.
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING WRONG WITH HIM.
SO, DOES HE HAVE A HUMP? A HUMP AND A HAIRPIECE?
WAIT, DOES HE EAT CHALK?
JUST 'CAUSE I DON'T WANT HER TO GO THROUGH WHAT I WENT THROUGH WITH CARL.
OKAY, EVERYBODY RELAX. THIS IS NOT A DATE.
IT'S TWO PEOPLE GOING OUT TO DINNER AND NOT HAVING SEX.
SOUNDS LIKE A DATE TO ME.
SO I'M BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL. I'M STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CAFETERIA
AND I REALIZE I AM TOTALLY... NAKED.
I'VE HAD THAT DREAM.
THEN, I LOOK DOWN AND I REALIZE THERE IS A PHONE...
THERE.
INSTEAD OF..? THAT'S RIGHT.
NEVER HAD THAT DREAM.
ALL OF A SUDDEN, THE PHONE STARTS TO RING
AND IT TURNS OUT IT'S MY MOTHER
WHICH IS VERY, VERY WEIRD BECAUSE... SHE NEVER CALLS ME.
HI.
THIS GUY SAYS "HELLO. I WANT TO KILL MYSELF."
ARE YOU OKAY, SWEETIE?
I FEEL LIKE SOMEONE REACHED DOWN MY THROAT GRABBED MY SMALL INTESTINE, PULLED IT OUT MY MOUTH
AND TIED IT AROUND MY NECK. COOKIE?
CAROL MOVED HER STUFF OUT TODAY.
LET ME GET YOU SOME COFFEE. THANKS.
NO. OH, NO. NO, DON'T. STOP CLEANSING MY AURA.
LEAVE MY AURA ALONE, OKAY?
I'LL BE FINE, ALL RIGHT? REALLY, EVERYONE. I HOPE SHE'LL BE VERY HAPPY. Monica: NO, YOU DON'T.
NO I DON'T. TO HELL WITH HER.
SHE LEFT ME.
AND YOU NEVER KNEW SHE WAS A LESBIAN?
NO. OKAY?
WHY DOES EVERYONE KEEP FIXATING ON THAT?
SHE DIDN'T KNOW. HOW SHOULD I KNOW?
SOMETIMES I WISH I WAS A LESBIAN.
DID I SAY THAT OUT LOUD?
ALL RIGHT, ROSS, LOOK
YOU'RE FEELING A LOT OF PAIN RIGHT NOW.
YOU'RE ANGRY. YOU'RE HURTING.
CAN I TELL YOU WHAT THE ANSWER IS?
STRIP JOINTS!
OH, COME ON. YOU'RE SINGLE.
SEE, BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE SINGLE, OKAY?
I JUST, I JUST, I JUST WANT TO BE MARRIED AGAIN.
AND I JUST WANT A MILLION DOLLARS.
RACHEL?
OH, GOD, MONICA, HI. THANK GOD.
I JUST WENT TO YOUR BUILDING AND YOU WEREN'T THERE
AND THEN THIS GUY WITH A BIG HAMMER
SAID THAT YOU MIGHT BE HERE, AND YOU ARE.
CAN I GET YOU SOME COFFEE? DECAF.
OKAY, EVERYBODY, THIS IS RACHEL ANOTHER LINCOLN HIGH SURVIVOR.
THIS IS EVERYBODY. THIS IS CHANDLER AND PHOEBE, AND JOEY
AND YOU REMEMBER MY BROTHER ROSS?
SURE.
HI. OH!
SO, YOU WANT TO TELL US NOW OR ARE WE WAITING FOR FOUR WET BRIDESMAIDS?
OH, GOD. WELL, IT STARTED
ABOUT A HALF HOUR BEFORE THE WEDDING.
I WAS IN THIS ROOM WHERE WE WERE KEEPING ALL THE PRESENTS
AND I WAS LOOKING AT THIS GRAVY BOAT--
THIS REALLY GORGEOUS LIMOGES GRAVY BOAT--
WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN...
SWEET AND LOW?
I REALIZED THAT I WAS MORE TURNED ON
BY THIS GRAVY BOAT THAN BY BARRY
AND THEN I GOT REALLY FREAKED OUT AND THAT'S WHEN IT HIT ME
HOW MUCH BARRY LOOKS LIKE MR. POTATO HEAD.
I MEAN, I ALWAYS KNEW HE LOOKED FAMILIAR, BUT...
ANYWAY, I JUST HAD TO GET OUT OF THERE
AND I STARTED WONDERING, "WHY AM I DOING THIS
AND WHO AM I DOING THIS FOR?"
SO, ANYWAY, I JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO GO AND I KNOW THAT YOU AND I HAVE DRIFTED APART
BUT YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON I KNEW WHO LIVED IN THE CITY.
WHO WASN'T INVITED TO THE WEDDING.
OH, I WAS KIND OF HOPING THAT WOULDN'T BE AN ISSUE.
Monica: NOW, I'M GUESSING THAT HE BOUGHT HER THE BIG PIPE ORGAN
AND SHE'S REALLY NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT.
DADDY, I JUST... I CAN'T MARRY HIM.
I'M SORRY.
I JUST DON'T LOVE HIM.
WELL, IT MATTERS TO ME.
Chandler: SHE SHOULD NOT BE WEARING THOSE PANTS.
I SAY PUSH HER DOWN THE STAIRS.
All: PUSH HER DOWN THE STAIRS! PUSH HER DOWN
THE STAIRS!
ALL RIGHT!
COME ON, DADDY, LISTEN TO ME.
ALL OF MY LIFE EVERYONE HAS ALWAYS TOLD ME, "YOU'RE A SHOE.
"YOU'RE A SHOE. YOU'RE A SHOE. YOU'RE A SHOE."
AND THEN TODAY I JUST STOPPED AND SAID "WHAT IF I DON'T WANT TO BE A SHOE?
"WHAT IF I WANT TO BE A PURSE?
OR A HAT?"
NO, I DON'T WANT YOU TO BUY ME A HAT. I'M SAYING THAT I AM A HAT...
IT'S A METAPHOR, DADDY!
YOU CAN SEE WHERE HE'D HAVE TROUBLE.
LOOK, DADDY, IT'S MY LIFE.
WELL, MAYBE I'LL JUST STAY HERE WITH MONICA.
WELL, I GUESS WE'VE ESTABLISHED SHE'S STAYING HERE WITH MONICA.
WELL, MAYBE THAT'S MY DECISION.
WELL, MAYBE I DON'T NEED YOUR MONEY.
WAIT, WAIT! I SAID MAYBE!
OKAY, JUST BREATHE. THAT'S IT.
JUST TRY TO THINK OF NICE, CALM THINGS.
‚ô™ RAINDROPS ON ROSES ‚ô™ ‚ô™ AND WHISKERS ON KITTENS ‚ô™
‚ô™ DOORBELLS AND SLEIGH BELLS ‚ô™ ‚ô™ AND SOMETHING WITH MITTENS ‚ô™
‚ô™ LA LA LA SOMETHING ‚ô™ ‚ô™ WITH STRING, THESE ARE A FEW... ‚ô™
I'M ALL BETTER NOW.
I HELPED.
OKAY, LOOK, THIS IS PROBABLY FOR THE BEST.
INDEPENDENCE... TAKING CONTROL OF YOUR LIFE.
AND HEY, YOU NEED ANYTHING
YOU CAN ALWAYS COME TO JOEY.
ME AND CHANDLER LIVE RIGHT ACROSS THE HALL
STOP HITTING ON HER. IT'S HER WEDDING DAY.
LIKE THERE'S A RULE OR SOMETHING? ( intercom buzzes )
PLEASE DON'T DO THAT AGAIN. IT'S A HORRIBLE SOUND.
Uh, it's-- it's Paul. BUZZ HIM IN.
WHO'S PAUL? "PAUL THE WINE GUY" PAUL?
MAYBE.
YOUR "NOT A REAL DATE" TONIGHT
IS WITH "PAUL THE WINE GUY"?
HE FINALLY ASKED YOU OUT? YES.
A "DEAR DIARY" MOMENT.
RACH, WAIT. I CAN CANCEL.
PLEASE, NO, GO. I'LL BE FINE.
ROSS, ARE YOU OKAY? I MEAN, DO YOU WANT ME TO STAY?
THAT WOULD BE GOOD.
REALLY? NO! GO ON!
IT'S "PAUL THE WINE GUY!"
HI. COME IN. PAUL, THIS IS...
EVERYBODY. EVERYBODY, THIS IS PAUL.
All: "PAUL THE WINE GUY!"
I DIDN'T CATCH YOUR NAME.
PAUL, WAS IT?
SIT DOWN. TWO SECONDS.
I JUST PULLED OUT FOUR EYELASHES. THAT CAN'T BE GOOD.
SO, RACHEL, WHAT ARE YOU UP TO TONIGHT?
I WAS KIND OF SUPPOSED TO BE HEADED FOR ARUBA ON MY HONEYMOON.
SO, NOTHING.
RIGHT. YOU'RE NOT EVEN GETTING YOUR HONEYMOON. GOD...
NO... ARUBA.
THIS TIME OF YEAR, TALK ABOUT YOUR...
BIG LIZARDS.
ANYWAY, IF YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE BEING ALONE TONIGHT
JOEY AND CHANDLER ARE HELPING ME PUT TOGETHER
MY NEW FURNITURE.
AND WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT IT.
THANKS, BUT I'M GOING TO HANG OUT HERE TONIGHT.
IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY. OH, SURE. OKAY, SURE.
PHEEBS, YOU WANT TO HELP?
I WISH I COULD, BUT I DON'T WANT TO.
I'M SUPPOSED TO ATTACH A BRACKETY THING TO THE SIDE THINGS
USING A BUNCH OF THESE LITTLE WORM GUYS.
I HAVE NO BRACKETY THING. I SEE NO WORM GUYS WHATSOEVER.
AND I CANNOT FEEL MY LEGS.
WHAT'S THIS?
I HAVE NO IDEA.
DONE WITH THE BOOKCASE! ALL FINISHED!
THIS WAS CAROL'S FAVORITE BEER.
SHE ALWAYS DRANK IT OUT OF THE CAN. I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.
ROSS, LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.
SHE GOT THE FURNITURE, THE STEREO, THE GOOD TV.
WHAT DID YOU GET?
YOU GUYS.
YOU GOT SCREWED. OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD. I KNOW. I'M SUCH AN IDIOT.
I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE CAUGHT ON WHEN SHE STARTED GOING TO THE DENTIST FOUR AND FIVE TIMES A WEEK.
I MEAN, HOW CLEAN CAN TEETH GET?
MY BROTHER'S GOING THROUGH THAT NOW. HE'S SUCH A MESS.
HOW DID YOU GET THROUGH IT?
HE MIGHT TRY ACCIDENTALLY BREAKING
SOMETHING VALUABLE OF HERS-- SAY, HER...
LEG?
THAT'S ONE WAY OF GOING THROUGH IT.
ME, I WENT FOR THE WATCH.
YOU ACTUALLY BROKE HER WATCH?
BARRY, I'M SORRY. I'M SO SORRY.
I KNOW YOU PROBABLY THINK
THIS IS ALL ABOUT WHAT I SAID THE OTHER NIGHT ABOUT YOU MAKING LOVE WITH YOUR SOCKS ON
BUT IT ISN'T. IT ISN'T-- IT'S ABOUT ME. AND I DID...
HI. MACHINE CUT ME OFF AGAIN. ANYWAY...
YOU KNOW WHAT THE SCARIEST PART IS?
WHAT IF THERE'S ONLY ONE WOMAN FOR EVERYBODY?
WHAT IF YOU GET ONE WOMAN AND THAT'S IT?
UNFORTUNATELY, IN MY CASE THERE WAS ONLY ONE WOMAN FOR HER.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
THAT'S LIKE SAYING THERE'S ONLY ONE FLAVOR OF ICE CREAM FOR YOU.
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, ROSS. THERE'S LOT OF FLAVORS OUT THERE.
THERE'S ROCKY ROAD AND COOKIE DOUGH AND BING CHERRY VANILLA.
YOU CAN GET THEM WITH JIMMIES OR NUTS OR WHIPPED CREAM.
THIS IS THE BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO YOU.
YOU GOT MARRIED. YOU WERE LIKE, WHAT, EIGHT?
WELCOME BACK TO THE WORLD. GRAB A SPOON.
I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW IF I'M HUNGRY OR HORNY.
THEN STAY OUT OF MY FREEZER.
EVER SINCE SHE WALKED OUT ON ME, I...
WHAT?
WHAT, YOU WANT TO SPELL IT OUT WITH NOODLES?
NO, IT'S MORE OF A FIFTH DATE KIND OF REVELATION.
OH, SO, THERE'S GOING TO BE A FIFTH DATE?
ISN'T THERE?
YEAH, YEAH, I THINK THERE IS.
WHAT WERE YOU GOING TO SAY?
WELL, WELL...
EVER SINCE SHE LEFT ME, UM...
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO PERFORM...
SEXUALLY.
OH, GOD. I'M SO SORRY.
IT'S OKAY.
BEING SPIT ON IS PROBABLY NOT WHAT YOU NEED RIGHT NOW.
HOW LONG?
TWO YEARS.
WOW.
I-I-I'M GLAD YOU SMASHED HER WATCH.
SO, YOU STILL THINK YOU, UM... MIGHT WANT THAT FIFTH DATE?
YEAH.
YEAH, I DO.
I, Joanie, take you, Charles as my lawful husband.
Do you take Joanie...
SEE, BUT JOANIE LOVED CHACHI.
THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE.
GRAB A SPOON.
DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT'S BEEN SINCE I GRABBED A SPOON?
DO THE WORDS "BILLY, DON'T BE A HERO" MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?
YOU KNOW, HERE'S THE THING.
EVEN IF I COULD GET IT TOGETHER ENOUGH TO ASK A WOMAN OUT
WHO AM I GOING TO ASK?
ISN'T THIS AMAZING?
I HAVE NEVER MADE COFFEE IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.
THAT IS AMAZING. CONGRATULATIONS.
WHILE YOU'RE ON A ROLL, IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU GOT TO MAKE A WESTERN OMELET OR SOMETHING...
ACTUALLY, I'M REALLY NOT THAT HUNGRY THIS MORNING.
MORNING.
MORNING. MORNING.
MORNING. MORNING, PAUL.
HELLO, PAUL. HI. PAUL, IS IT?
I HAD A GREAT TIME LAST NIGHT. Paul: THANK YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WE'LL TALK LATER. YEAH.
THANK YOU.
THAT WASN'T A REAL DATE.
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU DO ON A REAL DATE?
SHUT UP AND PUT MY TABLE BACK. Joey: OKAY.
ALL RIGHT, KIDS, I GOT TO GET TO WORK.
IF I DON'T INPUT THOSE NUMBERS...
IT DOESN'T MAKE MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE.
SO, LIKE, YOU GUYS ALL HAVE JOBS?
YEAH, WE ALL HAVE JOBS.
SEE, THAT'S HOW WE BUY STUFF.
YEAH. I'M AN ACTOR.
HAVE I SEEN YOU IN ANYTHING?
I DOUBT IT. MOSTLY REGIONAL WORK.
UNLESS YOU CAUGHT THE WEE ONES PRODUCTION OF PINOCCHIO.
"LOOK, GEPETTO, I'M A REAL LIVE BOY."
I WILL NOT TAKE THIS ABUSE.
I'M SORRY.
‚ô™ ONCE I WAS A WOODEN BOY, A LITTLE WOODEN BOY. ‚ô™
SO HOW YOU DOING TODAY? DID YOU SLEEP OKAY?
DID YOU TALK TO BARRY? I CAN'T STOP SMILING.
I CAN SEE THAT.
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU SLEPT WITH A HANGER IN YOUR MOUTH.
I KNOW. HE'S JUST SO...
YOU REMEMBER YOU AND TONY DEMARCO?
OH, YEAH.
WELL, IT'S LIKE THAT-- WITH FEELINGS.
OH, WOW, ARE YOU IN TROUBLE.
I AM JUST GOING TO GET UP, GO TO WORK
AND NOT THINK ABOUT HIM ALL DAY.
OR ELSE I'M JUST GOING TO GET UP AND GO TO WORK.
WISH ME LUCK. WHAT FOR?
I'M GOING TO GET ONE OF THOSE JOB THINGS.
HEY, MONICA. FRANNIE, WELCOME BACK.
HOW WAS FLORIDA?
YOU HAD SEX, DIDN'T YOU?
HOW DO YOU DO THAT?
SO, WHO?
YOU KNOW PAUL?
PAUL, THE WINE GUY?
OH, YEAH, I KNOW PAUL.
YOU MEAN, YOU KNOW PAUL LIKE I KNOW PAUL?
ARE YOU KIDDING? I TAKE CREDIT FOR PAUL.
YOU KNOW, BEFORE ME, THERE WAS NO SNAP IN HIS TURTLE FOR TWO YEARS.
OF COURSE IT WAS A LINE.
WHY WOULD ANYBODY DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT?!
I ASSUME WE'RE LOOKING FOR AN ANSWER
MORE SOPHISTICATED THAN "TO GET YOU INTO BED."
IS IT ME?!
IS IT LIKE I HAVE SOME SORT OF BEACON THAT ONLY DOGS
AND MEN WITH SEVERE EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS CAN HEAR?
GIVE ME YOUR FEET.
I JUST THOUGHT HE WAS NICE, YOU KNOW?
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS A LINE.
GUESS WHAT?
YOU GOT A JOB? ARE YOU KIDDING?
I'M TRAINED FOR NOTHING.
I WAS LAUGHED OUT OF 12 INTERVIEWS.
YET YOU'RE UPBEAT.
YOU WOULD BE, TOO, IF YOU FOUND JOAN AND DAVID BOOTS ON SALE 50 PERCENT OFF.
OH, HOW WELL YOU KNOW ME.
THEY'RE MY NEW I-DON'T-NEED-A-JOB,
I-DON'T-NEED-MY-PARENTS, I'VE-GOT-GREAT-BOOTS BOOTS.
HOW DID YOU PAY FOR THEM? A CREDIT CARD.
AND WHO PAYS FOR THAT?
UM... MY FATHER.
COME ON. YOU CAN'T LIVE OFF YOUR PARENTS YOUR WHOLE LIFE.
I KNOW THAT. THAT'S WHY I WAS GETTING MARRIED.
IT'S HARD BEING ON YOUR OWN THE FIRST TIME.
THANK YOU.
I REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST CAME HERE.
I WAS 14, MY MOM HAD JUST KILLED HERSELF
AND MY STEPDAD WAS BACK IN PRISON.
I GOT HERE AND DIDN'T KNOW ANYBODY.
I ENDED UP LIVING WITH THIS ALBINO GUY
WHO WAS CLEANING WINDSHIELDS OUTSIDE PORT AUTHORITY
AND THEN HE KILLED HIMSELF
AND THEN I FOUND AROMA THERAPY. SO I KNOW EXACTLY HOW YOU FEEL.
THE WORD YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IS...
"ANYWAY..."
ALL RIGHT. YOU READY?
I DON'T THINK SO.
CUT. CUT.
( chanting ): CUT. CUT. CUT. CUT. CUT.
( cheering )
WELCOME TO THE REAL WORLD. IT SUCKS.
YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE IT.
THAT'S IT.
YOU WANT TO CRASH ON THE COUCH?
NO. I GOT TO GO HOME. YOU GOING TO BE OKAY?
YEAH.
HEY, MON, LOOK WHAT I FOUND.
WHAT?
THAT'S PAUL'S WATCH.
PUT IT BACK WHERE YOU FOUND IT.
OH, BOY.
ALL RIGHT, GOOD NIGHT, EVERYBODY.
Both: GOOD NIGHT.
OH, SORRY.
OH, NO. GO. SPLIT IT?
OKAY.
THANKS.
YOU PROBABLY DIDN'T KNOW THIS BUT BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL I HAD A...
MAJOR CRUSH ON YOU.
I KNEW.
YOU DID?
I ALWAYS FIGURED YOU JUST THOUGHT I WAS MONICA'S GEEKY OLDER BROTHER.
OH.
LISTEN, DO YOU THINK--
AND TRY NOT TO LET MY INTENSE VULNERABILITY BECOME ANY KIND OF A FACTOR HERE--
BUT WOULD IT BE OKAY IF I ASKED YOU OUT SOMETIME MAYBE?
YEAH.
MAYBE.
OKAY.
OKAY, MAYBE I WILL.
GOOD NIGHT.
SEE YOU.
WAIT, WAIT. WHAT'S WITH YOU?
I JUST GRABBED A SPOON.
I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT I'M HEARING.
‚ô™ I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT I'M HEARING. ‚ô™
I SAID YOU HAD... ‚ô™ I SAID YOU HAD... ‚ô™
WOULD YOU STOP? WAS I DOING IT AGAIN?
All: YES!
WOULD ANYBODY LIKE MORE COFFEE?
DID YOU MAKE IT OR ARE YOU JUST SERVING IT?
I'M JUST SERVING IT.
YEAH. YEAH. YEAH.
KIDS, NEW DREAM.
I'M IN LAS VEGAS. I'M LIZA MINELLI.




WHAT YOU GUYS DON'T UNDERSTAND IS
FOR US, KISSING IS AS IMPORTANT AS ANY PART OF IT.
YEAH, RIGHT.
YOU SERIOUS?
OH, YEAH.
EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW IS IN THAT FIRST KISS.
ABSOLUTELY.
YEAH, I THINK FOR US
KISSING IS PRETTY MUCH LIKE AN OPENING ACT, YOU KNOW?
IT'S LIKE THE STAND-UP COMEDIAN YOU HAVE TO SIT THROUGH
BEFORE PINK FLOYD COMES IN.
YEAH, AND IT'S NOT THAT WE DON'T LIKE THE COMEDIAN.
IT'S JUST THAT THAT'S...
THAT'S NOT WHY WE BOUGHT THE TICKET.
THE PROBLEM IS, THOUGH
AFTER THE CONCERT'S OVER NO MATTER HOW GREAT THE SHOW WAS
YOU GIRLS ARE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR THE COMEDIAN AGAIN.
I MEAN WE'RE IN THE CAR, FIGHTING TRAFFIC.
BASICALLY, JUST TRYING TO STAY AWAKE.
YEAH, WELL, WORD OF ADVICE-- BRING BACK THE COMEDIAN.
OTHERWISE, NEXT TIME
YOU'RE GOING TO FIND YOURSELF SITTING AT HOME LISTENING TO THAT ALBUM ALONE.
ARE WE STILL TALKING ABOUT SEX?
Ross: NO, IT'S GOOD. IT IS GOOD.
IT'S JUST THAT, HMM... DOESN'T SHE SEEM A LITTLE ANGRY?
WELL, SHE HAS ISSUES.
DOES SHE?
HE'S OUT BANGING
WOMEN WITH A CLUB, WHILE SHE SITS AT HOME
TRYING TO GET THE MASTODON SMELL OUT OF THE CARPET.
MARSHA, YOU SEE THESE ARE CAVE PEOPLE.
THEY HAVE ISSUES LIKE
"GEE, THAT GLACIER'S GETTING KIND OF CLOSE." SEE?
SPEAKING OF ISSUES
ISN'T THAT YOUR EX-WIFE?
MY..? NO, NO. YES, IT IS.
CAROL, HI.
YES, IT IS. HOW ABOUT I'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU
IN THE ICE AGE.
HI.
SO...
YOU LOOK GREAT.
I UH...
I HATE THAT.
SORRY. THANKS. YOU LOOK GOOD TOO.
AH, WELL, YOU KNOW, IN HERE ANYONE WHO...
STANDS ERECT...
STILL, UH... A LESBIAN?
WELL...
YOU NEVER KNOW.
HOW'S UM... HOW'S THE FAMILY?
MARTY'S STILL TOTALLY PARANOID.
OH, AND THAT'S...
CAROL, WHY ARE YOU HERE, CAROL?
I'M PREGNANT. PREGNANT.
Ha! It looks like she didn't leave in such a hurry after all.
I THINK THIS IS THE EPISODE OF THREE'S COMPANY
WHERE THERE'S SOME KIND OF MISUNDERSTANDING.
OH, THEN I'VE ALREADY SEEN THIS ONE.
ARE YOU THROUGH WITH THAT?
YEAH, SORRY. THE SWALLOWING SLOWED ME DOWN.
WHOSE LITTLE BALL OF PAPER IS THIS? OH, THAT WOULD BE MINE.
SEE, I WROTE A NOTE TO MYSELF
THEN I REALIZED I DIDN'T NEED IT, SO I BALLED IT UP...
AND NOW I WISH I WAS DEAD.
SHE ALREADY FLUFFED THAT PILLOW. MONICA, YOU ALREADY...
BUT IT'S FINE.
I DON'T WANT TO GIVE THEM ANY MORE AMMUNITION THAN THEY ALREADY HAVE.
YES, AND WE ALL KNOW HOW CRUEL A PARENT CAN BE
ABOUT THE FLATNESS OF A CHILD'S PILLOW.
MONICA? HI.
UM, MONICA? YOU'RE SCARING ME.
I MEAN, YOU'RE LIKE ALL CHAOTIC AND TWIRLY, YOU KNOW?
AND NOT IN A GOOD WAY.
YEAH, CALM DOWN.
YOU DON'T SEE ROSS GETTING ALL
CHAOTIC AND TWIRLY EVERY TIME THEY COME.
THAT'S BECAUSE AS FAR AS MY PARENTS ARE CONCERNED
YOU SEE, HE'S A PRINCE.
APPARENTLY, THEY HAD SOME BIG CEREMONY BEFORE I WAS BORN.
UGLY NAKED GUY GOT A THIGH MASTER.
HAS ANYBODY SEEN MY ENGAGEMENT RING? YEAH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
OH, GOD. OH, GOD.
OH, GOD. OH, GOD. OH, GOD. NO, DON'T TOUCH THAT.
OH, LIKE I WASN'T DREADING TOMORROW ENOUGH. HAVING TO GIVE IT BACK TO HIM.
"HI, BARRY. REMEMBER ME? I'M THE GIRL IN THE VEIL
THAT STOMPED ON YOUR HEART IN FRONT OF YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY."
NOW I'M GOING TO HAVE TO RETURN THE RING WITHOUT THE RING
WHICH MAKES IT SO MUCH HARDER.
EASY, RACH. WE'LL FIND IT. WON'T WE?
OH. YEAH.
ALL RIGHT, WHEN DID YOU HAVE IT ON LAST?
DOY. PROBABLY RIGHT BEFORE SHE LOST IT.
YOU DON'T GET A LOT OF "DOY" THESE DAYS.
NO, I HAD IT THIS MORNING
AND I KNOW I HAD IT WHEN I WAS IN THE KITCHEN WITH...
DINAH?
OH, DON'T BE MAD.
YOU DIDN'T. OH, I'M SORRY.
I GAVE YOU ONE JOB.
OH, BUT LOOK HOW STRAIGHT THOSE NOODLES ARE.
THAT'S NOT HOW YOU LOOK FOR AN ENGAGEMENT RING
I JUST CAN'T DO IT.
BOYS?
WE'RE GOING IN.
HI.
OH, THAT IS NOT A HAPPY "HI."
CAROL'S PREGNANT.
OOH, I FOUND IT!
WELL, WHAT..? WHA-WHA..? WHAT..?
YEAH.
DO THAT FOR ANOTHER TWO HOURS
YOU MIGHT BE WHERE I AM RIGHT ABOUT NOW.
KIND OF PUTS THAT WHOLE PILLOW THING IN PERSPECTIVE, HUH, MON?
HOW DO YOU FIT INTO THIS WHOLE THING?
WELL, CAROL SAYS SHE AND SUSAN
WANT ME TO BE INVOLVED
BUT IF I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH IT I DON'T HAVE TO BE INVOLVED.
BASICALLY, IT'S TOTALLY UP TO ME.
SHE IS SO GREAT. I MISS HER.
WELL, WHAT DOES SHE MEAN BY "INVOLVED"?
PRESUMABLY, THE BIGGEST PART OF YOUR JOB IS DONE.
ANYWAY
THEY WANT ME TO GO DOWN TO THIS SONOGRAM THING
WITH THEM TOMORROW.
WHAT WILL YOU DO? I HAVE NO IDEA.
NO MATTER WHAT I DO, THOUGH
I'M STILL GOING TO BE A FATHER.
THIS IS STILL RUINED, RIGHT?
OH, MARTHA LUDWIN'S DAUGHTER IS GOING TO CALL YOU.
HMM, WHAT'S THAT CURRY TASTE?
CURRY.
I THINK THEY'RE GREAT. I REALLY DO. YOU REMEMBER THE LUDWINS.
THE BIG ONE HAD A THING FOR YOU, DIDN'T SHE?
THEY ALL HAD A THING FOR HIM.
Monica: I'M SORRY. WHY IS
THIS GIRL GOING TO CALL ME?
SHE JUST GRADUATED, AND SHE WANTS TO BE SOMETHING
IN COOKING OR FOOD OR... I DON'T KNOW.
I TOLD HER YOU HAVE A RESTAURANT...
NO, MOM. I DON'T
HAVE A RESTAURANT. I WORK IN A RESTAURANT.
WELL, THEY DON'T HAVE TO KNOW THAT.
ROSS, COULD YOU COME AND HELP ME WITH THE SPAGHETTI, PLEASE?
YES.
OH, WE'RE HAVING SPAGHETTI.
THAT'S... EASY.
I KNOW THIS IS GOING TO SOUND UNBELIEVABLY SELFISH ON MY PART
BUT WERE YOU PLANNING ON BRINGING UP THE WHOLE BABY-LESBIAN THING?
'CAUSE I THINK IT MIGHT TAKE SOME OF THE HEAT OFF ME.
WHAT THAT RACHEL DID TO HER LIFE. WE RAN INTO HER PARENTS AT THE CLUB.
THEY WEREN'T PLAYING WELL.
I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT THEY SPENT ON THAT WEDDING
BUT $40,000 IS A LOT OF MONEY.
WELL, AT LEAST SHE HAD THE CHANCE TO LEAVE A MAN AT THE ALTAR.
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? NOTHING.
IT'S AN EXPRESSION. NO, IT'S NOT.
DON'T LISTEN TO HER. YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN INDEPENDENT.
EVEN WHEN YOU WERE A KID
AND WERE CHUBBY, AND HAD NO FRIENDS
YOU WERE JUST FINE.
AND YOU WOULD READ ALONE IN YOUR ROOM-- AND YOUR PUZZLES.
LOOK, THERE ARE PEOPLE LIKE ROSS WHO NEED TO SHOOT FOR THE STARS
WITH HIS MUSEUM AND HIS PAPERS GETTING PUBLISHED.
OTHER PEOPLE ARE SATISFIED WITH STAYING WHERE THEY ARE.
I'M TELLING YOU, THESE ARE THE PEOPLE
I READ ABOUT THESE WOMEN TRYING TO HAVE IT ALL
AND I THANK GOD OUR LITTLE HARMONICA DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE THAT PROBLEM.
SO, ROSS, WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU?
NO NEWS, NO LITTLE ANECDOTES TO SHARE WITH THE FOLKS?
OKAY, OKAY.
LOOK, I REALIZE YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN WONDERING WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED
BETWEEN CAROL AND ME, AND SO, WELL...
HERE'S THE DEAL.
CAROL'S A LESBIAN.
SHE IS LIVING WITH A WOMAN NAMED SUSAN.
SHE'S PREGNANT WITH MY CHILD
AND SHE AND SUSAN ARE GOING TO RAISE THE BABY.
AND YOU KNEW ABOUT THIS?
FOLKS ARE REALLY THAT BAD, HUH?
WELL, YOU KNOW, THESE PEOPLE ARE PROS.
THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING. THEY TAKE THEIR TIME.
THEY GET THE JOB DONE.
I KNOW THEY SAY THAT YOU CAN'T CHANGE YOUR PARENTS.
BOY, IF YOU COULD I'D WANT YOURS.
MUST PEE.
IT'S EVEN WORSE WHEN YOU'RE TWINS.
YOU'RE A TWIN? YEAH. WE DON'T SPEAK.
SHE'S THIS HIGH-POWERED, DRIVEN, CAREER TYPE.
WHAT DOES SHE DO? SHE'S A WAITRESS.
ALL RIGHT, GUYS. I'VE KIND OF GOT TO CLEAN UP NOW.
YOU'RE AN ONLY CHILD, RIGHT? YOU DON'T HAVE THIS.
WELL, NO, ALTHOUGH I DID HAVE AN IMAGINARY FRIEND
WHO MY PARENTS ACTUALLY PREFERRED.
Rachel: HIT THE LIGHTS, PLEASE.
HOW LONG WAS I IN THERE?
I'M JUST CLEANING UP.
OH, YOU, UH, DO YOU NEED ANY HELP?
UM, OKAY, SURE. THANKS.
ANYWAY, UH, SO YOU
NERVOUS ABOUT BARRY TOMORROW?
UH, A LITTLE.
A LOT.
SO, GOT ANY ADVICE--
YOU KNOW, AS SOMEONE WHO'S RECENTLY BEEN DUMPED?
WELL, YOU MAY WANT TO STEER CLEAR OF THE WORD "DUMPED."
CHANCES ARE, HE'S GOING TO BE THIS THIS BROKEN SHELL OF A MAN.
SO YOU SHOULD TRY NOT TO LOOK TOO TERRIFIC. I KNOW IT'LL BE HARD.
UH, OR, YOU KNOW, I CAN, UH... HEY, I'LL GO DOWN THERE
AND GIVE BARRY BACK HIS RING
YOU CAN GO WITH CAROL AND SUSAN TO THE O.B.G.Y. N.
YOU'VE GOT CAROL TOMORROW.
UGH, WHEN DID IT GET SO COMPLICATED?
GOT ME.
REMEMBER IN HIGH SCHOOL? YEAH.
DIDN'T YOU THINK YOU WOULD MEET SOMEONE
FALL IN LOVE AND THAT WOULD BE IT?
YES, YES.
MAN, I NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE HERE.
ME NEITHER.
HI. OH, SORRY I'M LATE. I GOT STUCK AT WORK.
THERE WAS THIS BIG DINOSAUR THING. ANYWAY.
HI.
ROSS, YOU REMEMBER SUSAN. HOW COULD I FORGET?
ROSS.
HELLO SUSAN. GOOD SHAKE. GOOD SHAKE.
SO, UH, WE'RE JUST WAITING FOR...
DR. OBERMAN. DR. OBERMAN. AND IS HE..?
SHE. "SHE," OF COURSE.
SHE, UH, FAMILIAR WITH OUR SPECIAL SITUATION?
YES, AND SHE'S VERY SUPPORTIVE.
GREAT. OKAY, THAT'S GREAT.
NO, I'M... OH.
THANKS.
QUACK, QUACK. QUACK, QUACK.
QUACK, QUACK, QUACK.
ROSS...
THAT OPENS MY CERVIX.
COME ON IN.
ARE YOU SURE?
IT'S FINE. HE'LL BE HERE FOR HOURS. HUH?
HOW YOU DOING?
I'M...
I-I'M OKAY.
YOU LOOK GREAT.
YEAH, WELL...
Woman: Dr. Farber Jason Greenspan is gagging.
BE RIGHT THERE. BE BACK IN A SECOND.
I DUMPED HIM.
OKAY.
SO, UH... SO HOW'S THIS, UH... HOW'S THIS GOING TO WORK?
AHEM. YOU KNOW, WITH US?
YOU KNOW WHEN, LIKE
IMPORTANT DECISIONS HAVE TO BE MADE?
GIVE ME A "FOR INSTANCE."
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
HOW ABOUT WITH THE BABY'S NAME?
MARLON.
MARLON. OR "MINNIE" FOR A GIRL.
AS IN "MOUSE"?
AS IN MY GRANDMOTHER.
STILL, YOU SAY "MINNIE," YOU HEAR "MOUSE."
UM, HOW ABOUT, UM...
HOW ABOUT "JULIA"?
JULIA.
WE AGREED ON MINNIE.
WE AGREED WE'D SPEND OUR LIVES TOGETHER.
THINGS CHANGE-- ROLL WITH THE PUNCHES.
I BELIEVE JULIA'S ON THE TABLE.
SORRY ABOUT THAT.
SO, WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO?
OH, NOT MUCH.
I GOT A JOB. THAT'S GREAT.
WHY ARE YOU SO TAN?
OH, I, UH, I WENT TO ARUBA.
OH, NO. YOU WENT ON OUR HONEYMOON ALONE?
NO.
NO, ACTUALLY, UH...
I WENT WITH, UH...
NOW THIS MAY HURT. ME?
NO, NO.
I WENT WITH MINDY.
MINDY?
MY MAID OF HONOR, MINDY?
YEAH, WE'RE UH... KIND OF A THING NOW.
WELL, UM, I...
YOU GOT PLUGS.
CAREFUL THEY HAVEN'T QUITE TAKEN YET.
AND YOU GOT LENSES.
BUT YOU HATE STICKING YOUR FINGER IN YOUR EYE.
NOT FOR HER.
LISTEN, I REALLY WANTED TO THANK YOU.
OKAY.
A MONTH AGO, I WANTED TO HURT YOU--
MORE THAN I'VE EVER WANTED TO HURT ANYONE.
AND I'M AN ORTHODONTIST.
WOW.
YOU KNOW, YOU WERE RIGHT. I THOUGHT WE WERE HAPPY.
WE WEREN'T HAPPY.
BUT WITH MINDY...
NOW I'M HAPPY.
SPIT. WHAT?
ME.
ANYWAY, UM...
I GUESS, UH... I GUESS THIS BELONGS TO YOU.
AND THANK YOU FOR GIVING IT TO ME.
WELL, THANK YOU FOR GIVING IT BACK.
HELLO?
OH, PLEASE. WHAT'S WRONG WITH HELEN?
"HELEN GELLER"?
I DON'T THINK SO. IT WON'T BE HELEN GELLER.
THANK YOU.
NO, I MEAN IT'S NOT GELLER.
IT'S GOING TO BE "HELEN WILLICK?"
NO, ACTUALLY WE TALKED ABOUT
"HELEN WILLICK-BUNCH."
WELL, WAIT A MINUTE. WHY IS SHE IN THE TITLE?
IT'S MY BABY, TOO.
REALLY? I DON'T REMEMBER YOU MAKING ANY SPERM.
YEAH, AND WE ALL KNOW WHAT A CHALLENGE THAT IS.
SEE, SEE? YOU TWO STOP IT.
NO, SHE GETS CREDIT, I'M IN THERE TOO.
ROSS, YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY SUGGESTING "HELEN WILLICK-BUNCH-GELLER?"
THAT BORDERS ON CHILD ABUSE.
UH, OF COURSE NOT. I'M SUGGESTING "GELLER-WILLICK-BUNCH."
SEE WHAT HE'S DOING?
NO ONE WILL SAY ALL THOSE NAMES.
THEY'LL WIND UP CALLING HER "GELLER."
THEN HE GETS HIS WAY.
MY WAY? YOU THINK THIS IS MY WAY?
BELIEVE ME, OF ALL THE WAYS I EVER IMAGINED
THIS MOMENT IN MY LIFE BEING-- THIS IS NOT MY WAY.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS IS TOO HARD-- I CAN'T...
HOW ARE WE? ANY NAUSEA?
A LITTLE.
I WAS JUST WONDERING ABOUT THE MOTHER-TO-BE BUT THANKS FOR SHARING.
UH, LIE BACK.
UH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GOING TO GO.
I DON'T THINK I CAN BE INVOLVED IN THIS PARTICULAR FAMILY.
OH, MY GOD.
LOOK AT THAT.
I KNOW.
ISN'T THAT AMAZING?
WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO BE SEEING HERE?
I DON'T KNOW, BUT I THINK IT'S ABOUT
TO ATTACK THE ENTERPRISE.
IF YOU TILT YOUR HEAD TO THE LEFT AND RELAX YOUR EYES
IT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE AN OLD POTATO.
THEN DON'T DO THAT, ALL RIGHT? OKAY.
MONICA.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
ARE YOU WELLING UP?
NO.
YOU ARE. YOU'RE WELLING UP. NO, I'M NOT.
YOU'LL BE AN AUNT. ( sobbing ): SHUT UP.
HI, MINDY.
HI, I-IT'S RACHEL.
YEAH, I'M FINE. I-I SAW BARRY TODAY.
UH, YEAH, HE TOLD ME.
NO. NO, IT'S OKAY.
REALLY, IT'S OKAY.
I HOPE YOU TWO ARE VERY HAPPY, I REALLY DO.
UH, OH, AND MIN, YOU KNOW
IF EVERYTHING WORKS OUT AND YOU GUYS
END UP GETTING MARRIED AND HAVING KIDS AND EVERYTHING...
I HOPE THEY HAVE HIS OLD HAIRLINE AND YOUR OLD NOSE.
OKAY, I KNOW IT WAS A CHEAP SHOT BUT I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER NOW.



WHAT YOU GUYS DON'T UNDERSTAND IS
FOR US, KISSING IS AS IMPORTANT AS ANY PART OF IT.
YEAH, RIGHT.
YOU SERIOUS?
OH, YEAH.
EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW IS IN THAT FIRST KISS.
ABSOLUTELY.
YEAH, I THINK FOR US
KISSING IS PRETTY MUCH LIKE AN OPENING ACT, YOU KNOW?
IT'S LIKE THE STAND-UP COMEDIAN YOU HAVE TO SIT THROUGH
BEFORE PINK FLOYD COMES IN.
YEAH, AND IT'S NOT THAT WE DON'T LIKE THE COMEDIAN.
IT'S JUST THAT THAT'S...
THAT'S NOT WHY WE BOUGHT THE TICKET.
THE PROBLEM IS, THOUGH
AFTER THE CONCERT'S OVER NO MATTER HOW GREAT THE SHOW WAS
YOU GIRLS ARE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR THE COMEDIAN AGAIN.
I MEAN WE'RE IN THE CAR, FIGHTING TRAFFIC.
BASICALLY, JUST TRYING TO STAY AWAKE.
YEAH, WELL, WORD OF ADVICE-- BRING BACK THE COMEDIAN.
OTHERWISE, NEXT TIME
YOU'RE GOING TO FIND YOURSELF SITTING AT HOME LISTENING TO THAT ALBUM ALONE.
ARE WE STILL TALKING ABOUT SEX?
Ross: NO, IT'S GOOD. IT IS GOOD.
IT'S JUST THAT, HMM... DOESN'T SHE SEEM A LITTLE ANGRY?
WELL, SHE HAS ISSUES.
DOES SHE?
HE'S OUT BANGING
WOMEN WITH A CLUB, WHILE SHE SITS AT HOME
TRYING TO GET THE MASTODON SMELL OUT OF THE CARPET.
MARSHA, YOU SEE THESE ARE CAVE PEOPLE.
THEY HAVE ISSUES LIKE
"GEE, THAT GLACIER'S GETTING KIND OF CLOSE." SEE?
SPEAKING OF ISSUES
ISN'T THAT YOUR EX-WIFE?
MY..? NO, NO. YES, IT IS.
CAROL, HI.
YES, IT IS. HOW ABOUT I'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU
IN THE ICE AGE.
HI.
SO...
YOU LOOK GREAT.
I UH...
I HATE THAT.
SORRY. THANKS. YOU LOOK GOOD TOO.
AH, WELL, YOU KNOW, IN HERE ANYONE WHO...
STANDS ERECT...
STILL, UH... A LESBIAN?
WELL...
YOU NEVER KNOW.
HOW'S UM... HOW'S THE FAMILY?
MARTY'S STILL TOTALLY PARANOID.
OH, AND THAT'S...
CAROL, WHY ARE YOU HERE, CAROL?
I'M PREGNANT. PREGNANT.
Ha! It looks like she didn't leave in such a hurry after all.
I THINK THIS IS THE EPISODE OF THREE'S COMPANY
WHERE THERE'S SOME KIND OF MISUNDERSTANDING.
OH, THEN I'VE ALREADY SEEN THIS ONE.
ARE YOU THROUGH WITH THAT?
YEAH, SORRY. THE SWALLOWING SLOWED ME DOWN.
WHOSE LITTLE BALL OF PAPER IS THIS? OH, THAT WOULD BE MINE.
SEE, I WROTE A NOTE TO MYSELF
THEN I REALIZED I DIDN'T NEED IT, SO I BALLED IT UP...
AND NOW I WISH I WAS DEAD.
SHE ALREADY FLUFFED THAT PILLOW. MONICA, YOU ALREADY...
BUT IT'S FINE.
I DON'T WANT TO GIVE THEM ANY MORE AMMUNITION THAN THEY ALREADY HAVE.
YES, AND WE ALL KNOW HOW CRUEL A PARENT CAN BE
ABOUT THE FLATNESS OF A CHILD'S PILLOW.
MONICA? HI.
UM, MONICA? YOU'RE SCARING ME.
I MEAN, YOU'RE LIKE ALL CHAOTIC AND TWIRLY, YOU KNOW?
AND NOT IN A GOOD WAY.
YEAH, CALM DOWN.
YOU DON'T SEE ROSS GETTING ALL
CHAOTIC AND TWIRLY EVERY TIME THEY COME.
THAT'S BECAUSE AS FAR AS MY PARENTS ARE CONCERNED
YOU SEE, HE'S A PRINCE.
APPARENTLY, THEY HAD SOME BIG CEREMONY BEFORE I WAS BORN.
UGLY NAKED GUY GOT A THIGH MASTER.
HAS ANYBODY SEEN MY ENGAGEMENT RING? YEAH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
OH, GOD. OH, GOD.
OH, GOD. OH, GOD. OH, GOD. NO, DON'T TOUCH THAT.
OH, LIKE I WASN'T DREADING TOMORROW ENOUGH. HAVING TO GIVE IT BACK TO HIM.
"HI, BARRY. REMEMBER ME? I'M THE GIRL IN THE VEIL
THAT STOMPED ON YOUR HEART IN FRONT OF YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY."
NOW I'M GOING TO HAVE TO RETURN THE RING WITHOUT THE RING
WHICH MAKES IT SO MUCH HARDER.
EASY, RACH. WE'LL FIND IT. WON'T WE?
OH. YEAH.
ALL RIGHT, WHEN DID YOU HAVE IT ON LAST?
DOY. PROBABLY RIGHT BEFORE SHE LOST IT.
YOU DON'T GET A LOT OF "DOY" THESE DAYS.
NO, I HAD IT THIS MORNING
AND I KNOW I HAD IT WHEN I WAS IN THE KITCHEN WITH...
DINAH?
OH, DON'T BE MAD.
YOU DIDN'T. OH, I'M SORRY.
I GAVE YOU ONE JOB.
OH, BUT LOOK HOW STRAIGHT THOSE NOODLES ARE.
THAT'S NOT HOW YOU LOOK FOR AN ENGAGEMENT RING
I JUST CAN'T DO IT.
BOYS?
WE'RE GOING IN.
HI.
OH, THAT IS NOT A HAPPY "HI."
CAROL'S PREGNANT.
OOH, I FOUND IT!
WELL, WHAT..? WHA-WHA..? WHAT..?
YEAH.
DO THAT FOR ANOTHER TWO HOURS
YOU MIGHT BE WHERE I AM RIGHT ABOUT NOW.
KIND OF PUTS THAT WHOLE PILLOW THING IN PERSPECTIVE, HUH, MON?
HOW DO YOU FIT INTO THIS WHOLE THING?
WELL, CAROL SAYS SHE AND SUSAN
WANT ME TO BE INVOLVED
BUT IF I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH IT I DON'T HAVE TO BE INVOLVED.
BASICALLY, IT'S TOTALLY UP TO ME.
SHE IS SO GREAT. I MISS HER.
WELL, WHAT DOES SHE MEAN BY "INVOLVED"?
PRESUMABLY, THE BIGGEST PART OF YOUR JOB IS DONE.
ANYWAY
THEY WANT ME TO GO DOWN TO THIS SONOGRAM THING
WITH THEM TOMORROW.
WHAT WILL YOU DO? I HAVE NO IDEA.
NO MATTER WHAT I DO, THOUGH
I'M STILL GOING TO BE A FATHER.
THIS IS STILL RUINED, RIGHT?
OH, MARTHA LUDWIN'S DAUGHTER IS GOING TO CALL YOU.
HMM, WHAT'S THAT CURRY TASTE?
CURRY.
I THINK THEY'RE GREAT. I REALLY DO. YOU REMEMBER THE LUDWINS.
THE BIG ONE HAD A THING FOR YOU, DIDN'T SHE?
THEY ALL HAD A THING FOR HIM.
Monica: I'M SORRY. WHY IS
THIS GIRL GOING TO CALL ME?
SHE JUST GRADUATED, AND SHE WANTS TO BE SOMETHING
IN COOKING OR FOOD OR... I DON'T KNOW.
I TOLD HER YOU HAVE A RESTAURANT...
NO, MOM. I DON'T
HAVE A RESTAURANT. I WORK IN A RESTAURANT.
WELL, THEY DON'T HAVE TO KNOW THAT.
ROSS, COULD YOU COME AND HELP ME WITH THE SPAGHETTI, PLEASE?
YES.
OH, WE'RE HAVING SPAGHETTI.
THAT'S... EASY.
I KNOW THIS IS GOING TO SOUND UNBELIEVABLY SELFISH ON MY PART
BUT WERE YOU PLANNING ON BRINGING UP THE WHOLE BABY-LESBIAN THING?
'CAUSE I THINK IT MIGHT TAKE SOME OF THE HEAT OFF ME.
WHAT THAT RACHEL DID TO HER LIFE. WE RAN INTO HER PARENTS AT THE CLUB.
THEY WEREN'T PLAYING WELL.
I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT THEY SPENT ON THAT WEDDING
BUT $40,000 IS A LOT OF MONEY.
WELL, AT LEAST SHE HAD THE CHANCE TO LEAVE A MAN AT THE ALTAR.
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? NOTHING.
IT'S AN EXPRESSION. NO, IT'S NOT.
DON'T LISTEN TO HER. YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN INDEPENDENT.
EVEN WHEN YOU WERE A KID
AND WERE CHUBBY, AND HAD NO FRIENDS
YOU WERE JUST FINE.
AND YOU WOULD READ ALONE IN YOUR ROOM-- AND YOUR PUZZLES.
LOOK, THERE ARE PEOPLE LIKE ROSS WHO NEED TO SHOOT FOR THE STARS
WITH HIS MUSEUM AND HIS PAPERS GETTING PUBLISHED.
OTHER PEOPLE ARE SATISFIED WITH STAYING WHERE THEY ARE.
I'M TELLING YOU, THESE ARE THE PEOPLE
I READ ABOUT THESE WOMEN TRYING TO HAVE IT ALL
AND I THANK GOD OUR LITTLE HARMONICA DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE THAT PROBLEM.
SO, ROSS, WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU?
NO NEWS, NO LITTLE ANECDOTES TO SHARE WITH THE FOLKS?
OKAY, OKAY.
LOOK, I REALIZE YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN WONDERING WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED
BETWEEN CAROL AND ME, AND SO, WELL...
HERE'S THE DEAL.
CAROL'S A LESBIAN.
SHE IS LIVING WITH A WOMAN NAMED SUSAN.
SHE'S PREGNANT WITH MY CHILD
AND SHE AND SUSAN ARE GOING TO RAISE THE BABY.
AND YOU KNEW ABOUT THIS?
FOLKS ARE REALLY THAT BAD, HUH?
WELL, YOU KNOW, THESE PEOPLE ARE PROS.
THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING. THEY TAKE THEIR TIME.
THEY GET THE JOB DONE.
I KNOW THEY SAY THAT YOU CAN'T CHANGE YOUR PARENTS.
BOY, IF YOU COULD I'D WANT YOURS.
MUST PEE.
IT'S EVEN WORSE WHEN YOU'RE TWINS.
YOU'RE A TWIN? YEAH. WE DON'T SPEAK.
SHE'S THIS HIGH-POWERED, DRIVEN, CAREER TYPE.
WHAT DOES SHE DO? SHE'S A WAITRESS.
ALL RIGHT, GUYS. I'VE KIND OF GOT TO CLEAN UP NOW.
YOU'RE AN ONLY CHILD, RIGHT? YOU DON'T HAVE THIS.
WELL, NO, ALTHOUGH I DID HAVE AN IMAGINARY FRIEND
WHO MY PARENTS ACTUALLY PREFERRED.
Rachel: HIT THE LIGHTS, PLEASE.
HOW LONG WAS I IN THERE?
I'M JUST CLEANING UP.
OH, YOU, UH, DO YOU NEED ANY HELP?
UM, OKAY, SURE. THANKS.
ANYWAY, UH, SO YOU
NERVOUS ABOUT BARRY TOMORROW?
UH, A LITTLE.
A LOT.
SO, GOT ANY ADVICE--
YOU KNOW, AS SOMEONE WHO'S RECENTLY BEEN DUMPED?
WELL, YOU MAY WANT TO STEER CLEAR OF THE WORD "DUMPED."
CHANCES ARE, HE'S GOING TO BE THIS THIS BROKEN SHELL OF A MAN.
SO YOU SHOULD TRY NOT TO LOOK TOO TERRIFIC. I KNOW IT'LL BE HARD.
UH, OR, YOU KNOW, I CAN, UH... HEY, I'LL GO DOWN THERE
AND GIVE BARRY BACK HIS RING
YOU CAN GO WITH CAROL AND SUSAN TO THE O.B.G.Y. N.
YOU'VE GOT CAROL TOMORROW.
UGH, WHEN DID IT GET SO COMPLICATED?
GOT ME.
REMEMBER IN HIGH SCHOOL? YEAH.
DIDN'T YOU THINK YOU WOULD MEET SOMEONE
FALL IN LOVE AND THAT WOULD BE IT?
YES, YES.
MAN, I NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE HERE.
ME NEITHER.
HI. OH, SORRY I'M LATE. I GOT STUCK AT WORK.
THERE WAS THIS BIG DINOSAUR THING. ANYWAY.
HI.
ROSS, YOU REMEMBER SUSAN. HOW COULD I FORGET?
ROSS.
HELLO SUSAN. GOOD SHAKE. GOOD SHAKE.
SO, UH, WE'RE JUST WAITING FOR...
DR. OBERMAN. DR. OBERMAN. AND IS HE..?
SHE. "SHE," OF COURSE.
SHE, UH, FAMILIAR WITH OUR SPECIAL SITUATION?
YES, AND SHE'S VERY SUPPORTIVE.
GREAT. OKAY, THAT'S GREAT.
NO, I'M... OH.
THANKS.
QUACK, QUACK. QUACK, QUACK.
QUACK, QUACK, QUACK.
ROSS...
THAT OPENS MY CERVIX.
COME ON IN.
ARE YOU SURE?
IT'S FINE. HE'LL BE HERE FOR HOURS. HUH?
HOW YOU DOING?
I'M...
I-I'M OKAY.
YOU LOOK GREAT.
YEAH, WELL...
Woman: Dr. Farber Jason Greenspan is gagging.
BE RIGHT THERE. BE BACK IN A SECOND.
I DUMPED HIM.
OKAY.
SO, UH... SO HOW'S THIS, UH... HOW'S THIS GOING TO WORK?
AHEM. YOU KNOW, WITH US?
YOU KNOW WHEN, LIKE
IMPORTANT DECISIONS HAVE TO BE MADE?
GIVE ME A "FOR INSTANCE."
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
HOW ABOUT WITH THE BABY'S NAME?
MARLON.
MARLON. OR "MINNIE" FOR A GIRL.
AS IN "MOUSE"?
AS IN MY GRANDMOTHER.
STILL, YOU SAY "MINNIE," YOU HEAR "MOUSE."
UM, HOW ABOUT, UM...
HOW ABOUT "JULIA"?
JULIA.
WE AGREED ON MINNIE.
WE AGREED WE'D SPEND OUR LIVES TOGETHER.
THINGS CHANGE-- ROLL WITH THE PUNCHES.
I BELIEVE JULIA'S ON THE TABLE.
SORRY ABOUT THAT.
SO, WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO?
OH, NOT MUCH.
I GOT A JOB. THAT'S GREAT.
WHY ARE YOU SO TAN?
OH, I, UH, I WENT TO ARUBA.
OH, NO. YOU WENT ON OUR HONEYMOON ALONE?
NO.
NO, ACTUALLY, UH...
I WENT WITH, UH...
NOW THIS MAY HURT. ME?
NO, NO.
I WENT WITH MINDY.
MINDY?
MY MAID OF HONOR, MINDY?
YEAH, WE'RE UH... KIND OF A THING NOW.
WELL, UM, I...
YOU GOT PLUGS.
CAREFUL THEY HAVEN'T QUITE TAKEN YET.
AND YOU GOT LENSES.
BUT YOU HATE STICKING YOUR FINGER IN YOUR EYE.
NOT FOR HER.
LISTEN, I REALLY WANTED TO THANK YOU.
OKAY.
A MONTH AGO, I WANTED TO HURT YOU--
MORE THAN I'VE EVER WANTED TO HURT ANYONE.
AND I'M AN ORTHODONTIST.
WOW.
YOU KNOW, YOU WERE RIGHT. I THOUGHT WE WERE HAPPY.
WE WEREN'T HAPPY.
BUT WITH MINDY...
NOW I'M HAPPY.
SPIT. WHAT?
ME.
ANYWAY, UM...
I GUESS, UH... I GUESS THIS BELONGS TO YOU.
AND THANK YOU FOR GIVING IT TO ME.
WELL, THANK YOU FOR GIVING IT BACK.
HELLO?
OH, PLEASE. WHAT'S WRONG WITH HELEN?
"HELEN GELLER"?
I DON'T THINK SO. IT WON'T BE HELEN GELLER.
THANK YOU.
NO, I MEAN IT'S NOT GELLER.
IT'S GOING TO BE "HELEN WILLICK?"
NO, ACTUALLY WE TALKED ABOUT
"HELEN WILLICK-BUNCH."
WELL, WAIT A MINUTE. WHY IS SHE IN THE TITLE?
IT'S MY BABY, TOO.
REALLY? I DON'T REMEMBER YOU MAKING ANY SPERM.
YEAH, AND WE ALL KNOW WHAT A CHALLENGE THAT IS.
SEE, SEE? YOU TWO STOP IT.
NO, SHE GETS CREDIT, I'M IN THERE TOO.
ROSS, YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY SUGGESTING "HELEN WILLICK-BUNCH-GELLER?"
THAT BORDERS ON CHILD ABUSE.
UH, OF COURSE NOT. I'M SUGGESTING "GELLER-WILLICK-BUNCH."
SEE WHAT HE'S DOING?
NO ONE WILL SAY ALL THOSE NAMES.
THEY'LL WIND UP CALLING HER "GELLER."
THEN HE GETS HIS WAY.
MY WAY? YOU THINK THIS IS MY WAY?
BELIEVE ME, OF ALL THE WAYS I EVER IMAGINED
THIS MOMENT IN MY LIFE BEING-- THIS IS NOT MY WAY.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS IS TOO HARD-- I CAN'T...
HOW ARE WE? ANY NAUSEA?
A LITTLE.
I WAS JUST WONDERING ABOUT THE MOTHER-TO-BE BUT THANKS FOR SHARING.
UH, LIE BACK.
UH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GOING TO GO.
I DON'T THINK I CAN BE INVOLVED IN THIS PARTICULAR FAMILY.
OH, MY GOD.
LOOK AT THAT.
I KNOW.
ISN'T THAT AMAZING?
WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO BE SEEING HERE?
I DON'T KNOW, BUT I THINK IT'S ABOUT
TO ATTACK THE ENTERPRISE.
IF YOU TILT YOUR HEAD TO THE LEFT AND RELAX YOUR EYES
IT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE AN OLD POTATO.
THEN DON'T DO THAT, ALL RIGHT? OKAY.
MONICA.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
ARE YOU WELLING UP?
NO.
YOU ARE. YOU'RE WELLING UP. NO, I'M NOT.
YOU'LL BE AN AUNT. ( sobbing ): SHUT UP.
HI, MINDY.
HI, I-IT'S RACHEL.
YEAH, I'M FINE. I-I SAW BARRY TODAY.
UH, YEAH, HE TOLD ME.
NO. NO, IT'S OKAY.
REALLY, IT'S OKAY.
I HOPE YOU TWO ARE VERY HAPPY, I REALLY DO.
UH, OH, AND MIN, YOU KNOW
IF EVERYTHING WORKS OUT AND YOU GUYS
END UP GETTING MARRIED AND HAVING KIDS AND EVERYTHING...
I HOPE THEY HAVE HIS OLD HAIRLINE AND YOUR OLD NOSE.
OKAY, I KNOW IT WAS A CHEAP SHOT BUT I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER NOW.



HI, GUYS! HEY, PHOEBE!
HEY, OH, HOW DID IT GO?
UM, NOT SO GOOD.
HE SAID, "WE SHOULD DO THIS AGAIN."
WHAT? "WE SHOULD DO IT AGAIN."
THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT?
NO, LOOSELY TRANSLATED "WE SHOULD DO THIS AGAIN" MEANS
"YOU WILL NEVER SEE ME NAKED."
SINCE WHEN?
SINCE ALWAYS. IT'S LIKE DATING LANGUAGE.
YOU KNOW, LIKE, "IT'S NOT YOU" MEANS "IT IS YOU."
OR "YOU'RE SUCH A NICE GUY" MEANS:
"I'LL BE DATING LEATHER-WEARING ALCOHOLICS
AND COMPLAINING ABOUT THEM TO YOU."
OR "I THINK WE SHOULD SEE OTHER PEOPLE"
MEANS "HA, HA, I ALREADY AM."
AND EVERYBODY KNOWS THIS.
OH, YEAH... CUSHIONS THE BLOW.
LIKE WHEN YOU'RE A KID AND YOUR DOG DIES
AND THEY SAY IT WENT OFF TO SOME FARM.
THAT'S FUNNY. NO, BECAUSE OUR PARENTS ACTUALLY DID
SEND OUR DOG UP TO LIVE ON A FARM.
UH... ROSS?
WHAT, HELLO? THE MILNERS' FARM IN CONNECTICUT?
THE MILNERS HAD THIS UNBELIEVABLE FARM.
THEY HAD HORSES AND RABBITS TO CHASE
AND...
OH, MY GOD, CHI CHI!
Chandler: "SO HOW DOES IT FEEL KNOWING YOU'RE ABOUT TO DIE?"
"WARDEN, IN FIVE MINUTES MY PAIN WILL BE OVER
"BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO LIVE WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU SENT AN HONEST MAN TO DIE."
HEY, THAT WAS REALLY GOOD. YEAH? THANKS, LET'S KEEP GOING.
OKAY.
"SO, WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME, DIMONE... HUH?"
"I JUST WANT TO GO BACK TO MY CELL BECAUSE IN MY CELL I CAN SMOKE."
"SMOKE AWAY!"
I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY WHY DIMONE SMOKES IN HIS CELL, ALONE.
WHAT? RELAX YOUR HAND.
LET YOUR WRIST GO.
NOT SO MUCH.
ALL RIGHT, NOW, TRY TAKING A PUFF.
RIGHT.
OKAY, NO, GIVE IT TO ME. NO, NO, I'M NOT GIVING YOU A CIGARETTE.
DO YOU WANT TO GET THIS PART OR NOT? HERE.
ALL RIGHT, NOW DON'T THINK OF IT AS A CIGARETTE.
THINK OF IT AS THE THING THAT HAS BEEN MISSING FROM YOUR HAND.
WHEN YOU'RE HOLDING IT, YOU FEEL RIGHT, YOU FEEL COMPLETE.
DO YOU MISS IT?
NO, NOT SO MUCH.
ALL RIGHT, NOW WE SMOKE.
OH, MY GOD!
THEY SAY IT'S THE SAME AS THE DISTANCE
FROM THE TIP OF A GUY'S THUMB TO THE TIP OF HIS INDEX FINGER.
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
CAN I USE EITHER THUMB?
ALL RIGHT, DON'T TELL ME, DON'T TELL ME.
DECAF CAPPUCCINO FOR JOEY.
COFFEE BLACK.
LATTE.
AND AN ICED TEA.
I'M GETTING GOOD AT THIS.
EXCELLENT! VERY GOOD.
GOOD FOR ME!
YOU OKAY, PHOEBE? YEAH, NO, I'M... IT'S NOT EVEN WORTH IT--
IT'S MY BANK.
WHAT DID THEY DO?
IT'S JUST... OKAY.
I'M GOING THROUGH MY MAIL AND I OPEN UP THEIR MONTHLY STATEMENT!
EASY!
AND THERE'S $500 EXTRA IN MY ACCOUNT.
OH, SATAN'S MINIONS AT WORK AGAIN.
NOW I HAVE TO GO THERE AND DEAL WITH THEM...
WHAT? KEEP IT! IT'S NOT MINE.
I DIDN'T EARN IT. IT WOULD BE LIKE STEALING.
YEAH, BUT IF YOU SPENT IT, IT WOULD BE LIKE SHOPPING.
OKAY, OKAY, LET'S SAY I BOUGHT A REALLY GREAT PAIR OF SHOES.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'D HEAR WITH EVERY STEP I TOOK?
"NOT MINE, NOT MINE, NOT MINE."
EVEN IF I WAS HAPPY, AND SKIPPING, I'D HEAR
"NOT, NOT MINE, NOT, NOT MINE..."
WE'RE WITH YOU, WE GOT IT.
I'D NEVER ENJOY IT.
IT WOULD BE LIKE THIS GIANT KARMIC DEBT.
Monica: CHANDLER, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
HEY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT IS THIS?
I'M SMOKING, I'M SMOKING.
YOU'VE BEEN SO GOOD FOR THREE YEARS.
AND THIS IS MY REWARD.
THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU WENT THROUGH THE LAST TIME YOU QUIT.
OKAY, SO THIS TIME I WON'T QUIT.
PUT IT OUT! I'M PUTTING IT OUT.
OH, NO! I CAN'T DRINK THIS NOW.
I'M GOING TO GO CHANGE. I'VE GOT A DATE.
WITH ALAN AGAIN? HOW'S IT GOING?
IT'S GOING PRETTY GOOD, YOU KNOW. HE'S NICE, WE'RE HAVING FUN.
WHEN DO WE MEET HIM?
LET'S SEE, TODAY IS MONDAY.
NEVER.
NO, NOT AFTER WHAT HAPPENED WITH STEVE.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
( imitates lisp ): WE LOVED SCHTEVE. SCHTEVE WAS SCHEXY.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT HIM.
LET ME FIGURE THAT OUT.
THEN CAN WE MEET HIM?
MMM... NO... SCHORRY.
Monica: I MEAN, WHY SHOULD I LET THEM MEET HIM?
I BRING A GUY HOME
AND SOON THEY'RE ALL OVER HIM.
THEY'RE LIKE COYOTES PICKING OFF THE WEAK MEMBERS OF THE HERD.
LISTEN, AS SOMEONE WHO'S SEEN MORE THAN HER SHARE OF BAD BEEF
THAT IS NOT SUCH A TERRIBLE THING.
YOUR FRIENDS ARE JUST LOOKING OUT AFTER YOU.
JUST ONCE I WISH I'D BRING A GUY HOME THEY LIKED.
WELL, YOU DO REALIZE THAT THE ODDS OF THAT HAPPENING
ARE A LITTLE SLIMMER IF THEY NEVER MEET THE GUY.
LET IT GO, ROSS.
YEAH, WELL, YOU DIDN'T KNOW CHI CHI.
Monica: DO YOU ALL PROMISE?
All: YEAH, WE PROMISE. WE'LL BE GOOD.
CHANDLER, DO YOU PROMISE?
YOU CAN COME IN BUT YOUR FILTER-TIPPED LITTLE BUDDY STAYS OUTSIDE.
Ross: HEY, PHOEBES!
"DEAR MS. BUFFAY: "THANK YOU FOR CALLING ATTENTION TO OUR ERROR.
"WE HAVE CREDITED YOUR ACCOUNT $500. "WE'RE SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE
"AND HOPE YOU'LL ACCEPT "THIS FOOTBALL PHONE...
AS OUR FREE GIFT." DO YOU BELIEVE THIS?
NOW I HAVE $1,000 AND A FOOTBALL PHONE.
WHAT BANK IS THIS?
OKAY, IT'S HIM.
WHO IS IT? Alan.
CHANDLER, HE'S HERE!
OKAY, PLEASE BE GOOD, PLEASE.
JUST REMEMBER HOW MUCH YOU LIKE ME.
HI, ALAN, THIS IS EVERYBODY. EVERYBODY, THIS IS ALAN.
HI.
All: HI, ALAN.
I'VE HEARD SCHO MUSCH ABOUT ALL YOU GUYS.
I'LL CALL YOU TOMORROW. THANK YOU.
OKAY... OKAY, LET'S LET THE ALAN-BASHING BEGIN.
WHO'S GOING TO TAKE THE FIRST SHOT? HMM?
COME ON!
I'LL GO.
LET'S START WITH THE WAY HE KEPT PICKING AT...
YOU KNOW, I'M SORRY, I CAN'T DO THIS.
WE LOVED HIM.
All: WE LOVED HIM!
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE THAT I'M GOING OUT WITH?
All: YES!
AND DID YOU NOTICE?
Men: YEAH, IT'S GREAT.
YOU KNOW WHAT WAS GREAT? HOW HIS SMILE WAS CROOKED.
YES, LIKE THE MAN IN THE SHOE.
WHAT SHOE?
FROM THE NURSERY RHYME:
"THERE WAS A CROOKED MAN WHO HAD A CROOKED SMILE
"WHO LIVED IN A SHOE FOR A... WHILE."
SO I THINK ALAN... WILL BECOME THE YARDSTICK
AGAINST WHICH ALL FUTURE BOYFRIENDS WILL BE MEASURED.
WHAT FUTURE BOYFRIENDS?
NO, I THINK THIS COULD BE...
REALLY?
I'D MARRY HIM FOR HIS DAVID HASSELHOFF IMPRESSION.
YOU KNOW I'M GOING TO BE DOING THAT AT PARTIES, RIGHT?
YOU KNOW WHAT I LIKE MOST ABOUT HIM? WHAT?
THE WAY HE MAKES ME FEEL ABOUT MYSELF.
YEAH. YEAH. YEAH. YEAH.
HI.
HOW WAS THE GAME?
WELL...
All: WE WON!
FANTASTIC! I HAVE ONE QUESTION. HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?
ALAN. HE WAS UNBELIEVABLE.
HE WAS LIKE THAT BUGS BUNNY CARTOON WHERE BUGS IS PLAYING ALL THE POSITIONS
BUT INSTEAD IT WAS FIRST BASE, ALAN; SECOND BASE, ALAN; THIRD BASE, ALAN.
I MEAN, IT WAS LIKE HE MADE US INTO A TEAM.
YEP, WE SURE SHOWED THOSE HASIDIC JEWELERS
A THING OR TWO ABOUT SOFTBALL.
CAN I ASK YOU GUYS A QUESTION?
DO YOU EVER THINK THAT ALAN IS MAYBE SOMETIMES...
I DON'T KNOW, A LITTLE TOO ALAN?
Rachel: OH, NO, THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE. ONE CAN NEVER BE TOO ALAN.
YEAH, IT'S HIS INNATE ALAN-NESS THAT WE ADORE.
I PERSONALLY COULD HAVE A GALLON OF ALAN.
HEY, LIZZY. HEY, WEIRD GIRL.
I BROUGHT YOU ALPHABET SOUP. WITHOUT THE VOWELS?
YES, BUT I LEFT IN THE "Y"s
BECAUSE YOU KNOW, "SOMETIMES Y..."
I HAVE SOMETHING ELSE. SALTINES?
NO, BUT WOULD YOU LIKE $1,000 AND A FOOTBALL PHONE?
WHAT?
OH, MY GOD!
THERE'S REALLY MONEY IN HERE. I KNOW.
WEIRD GIRL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I WANT YOU TO HAVE IT.
NO, NO, I HAVE TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING.
NO, IT'S FINE, YOU DON'T...
DO YOU WANT MY TINFOIL HAT?
NO, BECAUSE YOU NEED THAT.
PLEASE, LET ME DO SOMETHING.
OKAY, ALL RIGHT, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
YOU BUY ME A SODA, AND THEN WE'RE EVEN, OKAY?
OKAY. OKAY.
KEEP THE CHANGE.
THANKS, LIZZY. SURE YOU DON'T WANT A PRETZEL?
NO, I'M FINE, THANKS. SEE YOU.
A THUMB?
I KNOW, I KNOW, I OPENED IT UP
AND IT WAS FLOATING IN THERE LIKE THIS TINY HITCHHIKER.
MAYBE IT'S A CONTEST, LIKE, COLLECT ALL FIVE.
DOES ANYONE WANT TO SEE?
All: NO!
OH, HEY, DON'T DO THAT. PUT THAT OUT. COME ON!
IT'S WORSE THAN THE THUMB.
HEY, THIS IS SO UNFAIR.
WHY IS IT UNFAIR?
SO I HAVE A FLAW. BIG DEAL!
LIKE JOEY'S CONSTANT KNUCKLE CRACKING
ISN'T ANNOYING?
AND ROSS WHO OVERPRONOUNCES EVERY WORD;
AND MONICA WITH THAT SNORT WHEN SHE LAUGHS.
I MEAN WHAT THE HELL IS THAT THING?
I ACCEPT ALL THOSE FLAWS. WHY CAN'T YOU ACCEPT ME FOR THIS?
DOES THE KNUCKLE CRACKING BOTHER EVERYBODY?
WELL, I COULD LIVE WITHOUT IT.
OH, WELL, IS IT, LIKE, A LITTLE ANNOYING
OR IS LIKE WHEN PHOEBE CHEWS HER HAIR?
NOW, DON'T LISTEN TO HIM, PHOEBES. I THINK IT'S ENDEARING.
OH, YOU DO, DO YOU?
YOU KNOW, THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH SPEAKING CORRECTLY.
INDEED, THERE ISN'T.
I SHOULD REALLY GET BACK TO WORK.
OTHERWISE SOMEONE MIGHT GET WHAT THEY ORDERED.
Joey: OOH, WELL!
OH, HO, HO, THE HAIR COMES OUT AND THE GLOVES COME OFF.
DID YOU EVER GO OUT WITH A GUY YOUR FRIENDS ALL REALLY LIKED?
NO.
OKAY. WELL, I'M GOING OUT
WITH A GUY MY FRIENDS ALL REALLY LIKE.
WERE WE TALKING ABOUT THE COYOTES HERE?
ALL RIGHT! A COW GOT THROUGH!
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?
IT'S JUST... YOU KNOW WHAT?
I JUST DON'T FEEL THE THING.
I MEAN, THEY FEEL THE THING, I DON'T FEEL THE THING.
HONEY, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS FEEL THE THING.
IF THAT'S HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THE GUY, DUMP HIM.
I KNOW, IT'S JUST GOING TO BE REALLY HARD.
HE'S A BIG BOY, HE'LL GET OVER IT.
NO, HE'LL BE FINE. IT'S THE OTHER FIVE I'M WORRIED ABOUT.
DON'T YOU RESPECT YOUR BODY?
DON'T YOU REALIZE WHAT YOU'RE DOING?
I'VE HAD IT WITH YOU GUYS AND YOUR CANCER
AND YOUR EMPHYSEMA AND YOUR HEART DISEASE.
SMOKING IS COOL AND YOU KNOW IT.
CHANDLER... IT'S ALAN, HE WANTS TO SPEAK WITH YOU.
REALLY, HE DOES?
HEY, BUDDY, WHAT'S UP?
OH, SHE TOLD YOU ABOUT THAT, HUH?
WELL, YEAH, I HAVE ONE NOW AND THEN. WELL, YEAH, NOW.
WELL, IT'S NOT THAT...
WELL, THAT'S TRUE.
GEE, YOU KNOW, NO ONE'S... NO ONE'S EVER PUT IT LIKE THAT BEFORE.
SO, WELL, OKAY, THANKS.
GOD, HE'S GOOD.
IF ONLY HE WERE A WOMAN.
YEAH.
And Lamb Chop and Hush Puppy...
HOW OLD IS THAT SOCK?
IF I HAD A SOCK ON MY HAND FOR 30 YEARS IT'D BE TALKING, TOO.
OKAY, I THINK IT'S TIME TO CHANGE SOMEBODY'S NICOTINE PATCH.
HEY!
WHERE'S JOEY?
JOEY ATE MY LAST STICK OF GUM SO I KILLED HIM.
DO YOU THINK THAT WAS WRONG?
HE'S ACROSS THE HALL. THANKS.
THERE YOU GO.
OOH, I'M ALIVE WITH PLEASURE NOW.
HEY, PHOEBES, YOU GOING TO HAVE THE REST OF THAT POP-TART? PHOEBES?
DOES ANYONE WANT THE REST OF THIS POP-TART?
HEY, I MIGHT.
SORRY.
YOU KNOW, THOSE STUPID SODA PEOPLE GAVE ME $7,000 FOR THE THUMB.
$7,000?
AND ON MY WAY OVER HERE
I STEPPED IN GUM.
WHAT IS UP WITH THE UNIVERSE?
WHAT'S GOING ON?
NOTHING, I JUST THINK IT'S NICE WHEN WE'RE ALL HERE TOGETHER.
NICER WHEN EVERYONE GETS TO WEAR THEIR UNDERWEAR.
UH, JOEY.
OH.
OH, OKAY.
( protestations )
PLEASE, GUYS WE HAVE TO TALK.
WAIT, WAIT. I'M GETTING A DEJA VU.
NO, I'M NOT.
ALL RIGHT, WE HAVE TO TALK. THERE IT IS!
OKAY, IT'S ABOUT ALAN.
THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW.
I MEAN, THERE'S REALLY NO EASY WAY TO SAY THIS.
I'VE DECIDED TO BREAK UP WITH ALAN.
IS THERE SOMEBODY ELSE?
NO, NO, NO, NO, IT'S JUST...
YOU KNOW, THINGS CHANGE, PEOPLE CHANGE.
WE DIDN'T CHANGE.
SO THAT'S IT? IT'S OVER?
JUST LIKE THAT?
YOU KNOW, YOU LET YOUR GUARD DOWN
YOU KNOW, YOU START TO REALLY CARE ABOUT SOMEONE AND I JUST... I...
LOOK, I CAN GO ON PRETENDING... OKAY.
NO. IT WOULDN'T BE FAIR TO ALAN, OR TO YOU.
YEAH, WELL, WHO WANTS FAIR?
I MEAN, I JUST WANT THINGS BACK YOU KNOW, THE WAY THEY WERE.
I'M SORRY. OH, SHE'S SORRY. I FEEL BETTER.
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
I MEAN, WITH THE HOLIDAYS COMING UP. I WANTED HIM TO MEET MY FAMILY.
I'LL MEET SOMEONE ELSE. THERE'LL BE OTHER ALANS.
OH, YEAH, RIGHT.
WILL YOU GUYS BE OKAY? HEY, HEY, WE'LL BE FINE.
WE'RE JUST GOING TO NEED A LITTLE TIME.
I UNDERSTAND.
I'M REALLY SORRY. YEAH. I'M SORRY, TOO.
BUT I GOT TO TELL YOU, I AM A LITTLE RELIEVED.
RELIEVED?
WELL, I MEAN, I HAD A GREAT TIME WITH YOU...
I JUST CAN'T STAND YOUR FRIENDS.
REMEMBER WHEN WE WENT TO CENTRAL PARK AND RENTED BOATS?
THAT WAS FUN.
YEAH. HE COULD ROW LIKE A VIKING.
( all mumble )
SO HOW DID IT GO?
UH... YOU KNOW. DID... DID HE MENTION US?
HE SAYS HE'S REALLY GOING TO MISS YOU GUYS.
YOU HAD A ROUGH DAY, HUH?
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.
THAT'S IT, I'M GETTING CIGARETTES.
All: NO, NO, NO!
I DON'T CARE.
GAME'S OVER, I'M WEAK. I MUST HAVE THE SMOKE.
Phoebe: IF YOU NEVER SMOKE AGAIN I'LL GIVE YOU $7,000.
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
LOOK AT THAT.
I KNOW.
ISN'T THAT AMAZING?
WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO BE SEEING HERE?
I DON'T KNOW, BUT I THINK IT'S ABOUT
TO ATTACK THE ENTERPRISE.
IF YOU TILT YOUR HEAD TO THE LEFT AND RELAX YOUR EYES
IT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE AN OLD POTATO.
THEN DON'T DO THAT, ALL RIGHT? OKAY.
MONICA.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
ARE YOU WELLING UP?
NO.
YOU ARE. YOU'RE WELLING UP. NO, I'M NOT.
YOU'LL BE AN AUNT. ( sobbing ): SHUT UP.
HI, MINDY.
HI, I-IT'S RACHEL.
YEAH, I'M FINE. I-I SAW BARRY TODAY.
UH, YEAH, HE TOLD ME.
NO. NO, IT'S OKAY.
REALLY, IT'S OKAY.
I HOPE YOU TWO ARE VERY HAPPY, I REALLY DO.
UH, OH, AND MIN, YOU KNOW
IF EVERYTHING WORKS OUT AND YOU GUYS
END UP GETTING MARRIED AND HAVING KIDS AND EVERYTHING...
I HOPE THEY HAVE HIS OLD HAIRLINE AND YOUR OLD NOSE.
OKAY, I KNOW IT WAS A CHEAP SHOT BUT I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER NOW.




HI, GUYS! HEY, PHOEBE!
HEY, OH, HOW DID IT GO?
UM, NOT SO GOOD.
HE SAID, "WE SHOULD DO THIS AGAIN."
WHAT? "WE SHOULD DO IT AGAIN."
THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT?
NO, LOOSELY TRANSLATED "WE SHOULD DO THIS AGAIN" MEANS
"YOU WILL NEVER SEE ME NAKED."
SINCE WHEN?
SINCE ALWAYS. IT'S LIKE DATING LANGUAGE.
YOU KNOW, LIKE, "IT'S NOT YOU" MEANS "IT IS YOU."
OR "YOU'RE SUCH A NICE GUY" MEANS:
"I'LL BE DATING LEATHER-WEARING ALCOHOLICS
AND COMPLAINING ABOUT THEM TO YOU."
OR "I THINK WE SHOULD SEE OTHER PEOPLE"
MEANS "HA, HA, I ALREADY AM."
AND EVERYBODY KNOWS THIS.
OH, YEAH... CUSHIONS THE BLOW.
LIKE WHEN YOU'RE A KID AND YOUR DOG DIES
AND THEY SAY IT WENT OFF TO SOME FARM.
THAT'S FUNNY. NO, BECAUSE OUR PARENTS ACTUALLY DID
SEND OUR DOG UP TO LIVE ON A FARM.
UH... ROSS?
WHAT, HELLO? THE MILNERS' FARM IN CONNECTICUT?
THE MILNERS HAD THIS UNBELIEVABLE FARM.
THEY HAD HORSES AND RABBITS TO CHASE
AND...
OH, MY GOD, CHI CHI!
Chandler: "SO HOW DOES IT FEEL KNOWING YOU'RE ABOUT TO DIE?"
"WARDEN, IN FIVE MINUTES MY PAIN WILL BE OVER
"BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO LIVE WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU SENT AN HONEST MAN TO DIE."
HEY, THAT WAS REALLY GOOD. YEAH? THANKS, LET'S KEEP GOING.
OKAY.
"SO, WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME, DIMONE... HUH?"
"I JUST WANT TO GO BACK TO MY CELL BECAUSE IN MY CELL I CAN SMOKE."
"SMOKE AWAY!"
I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY WHY DIMONE SMOKES IN HIS CELL, ALONE.
WHAT? RELAX YOUR HAND.
LET YOUR WRIST GO.
NOT SO MUCH.
ALL RIGHT, NOW, TRY TAKING A PUFF.
RIGHT.
OKAY, NO, GIVE IT TO ME. NO, NO, I'M NOT GIVING YOU A CIGARETTE.
DO YOU WANT TO GET THIS PART OR NOT? HERE.
ALL RIGHT, NOW DON'T THINK OF IT AS A CIGARETTE.
THINK OF IT AS THE THING THAT HAS BEEN MISSING FROM YOUR HAND.
WHEN YOU'RE HOLDING IT, YOU FEEL RIGHT, YOU FEEL COMPLETE.
DO YOU MISS IT?
NO, NOT SO MUCH.
ALL RIGHT, NOW WE SMOKE.
OH, MY GOD!
THEY SAY IT'S THE SAME AS THE DISTANCE
FROM THE TIP OF A GUY'S THUMB TO THE TIP OF HIS INDEX FINGER.
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
CAN I USE EITHER THUMB?
ALL RIGHT, DON'T TELL ME, DON'T TELL ME.
DECAF CAPPUCCINO FOR JOEY.
COFFEE BLACK.
LATTE.
AND AN ICED TEA.
I'M GETTING GOOD AT THIS.
EXCELLENT! VERY GOOD.
GOOD FOR ME!
YOU OKAY, PHOEBE? YEAH, NO, I'M... IT'S NOT EVEN WORTH IT--
IT'S MY BANK.
WHAT DID THEY DO?
IT'S JUST... OKAY.
I'M GOING THROUGH MY MAIL AND I OPEN UP THEIR MONTHLY STATEMENT!
EASY!
AND THERE'S $500 EXTRA IN MY ACCOUNT.
OH, SATAN'S MINIONS AT WORK AGAIN.
NOW I HAVE TO GO THERE AND DEAL WITH THEM...
WHAT? KEEP IT! IT'S NOT MINE.
I DIDN'T EARN IT. IT WOULD BE LIKE STEALING.
YEAH, BUT IF YOU SPENT IT, IT WOULD BE LIKE SHOPPING.
OKAY, OKAY, LET'S SAY I BOUGHT A REALLY GREAT PAIR OF SHOES.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'D HEAR WITH EVERY STEP I TOOK?
"NOT MINE, NOT MINE, NOT MINE."
EVEN IF I WAS HAPPY, AND SKIPPING, I'D HEAR
"NOT, NOT MINE, NOT, NOT MINE..."
WE'RE WITH YOU, WE GOT IT.
I'D NEVER ENJOY IT.
IT WOULD BE LIKE THIS GIANT KARMIC DEBT.
Monica: CHANDLER, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
HEY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT IS THIS?
I'M SMOKING, I'M SMOKING.
YOU'VE BEEN SO GOOD FOR THREE YEARS.
AND THIS IS MY REWARD.
THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU WENT THROUGH THE LAST TIME YOU QUIT.
OKAY, SO THIS TIME I WON'T QUIT.
PUT IT OUT! I'M PUTTING IT OUT.
OH, NO! I CAN'T DRINK THIS NOW.
I'M GOING TO GO CHANGE. I'VE GOT A DATE.
WITH ALAN AGAIN? HOW'S IT GOING?
IT'S GOING PRETTY GOOD, YOU KNOW. HE'S NICE, WE'RE HAVING FUN.
WHEN DO WE MEET HIM?
LET'S SEE, TODAY IS MONDAY.
NEVER.
NO, NOT AFTER WHAT HAPPENED WITH STEVE.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
( imitates lisp ): WE LOVED SCHTEVE. SCHTEVE WAS SCHEXY.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT HIM.
LET ME FIGURE THAT OUT.
THEN CAN WE MEET HIM?
MMM... NO... SCHORRY.
Monica: I MEAN, WHY SHOULD I LET THEM MEET HIM?
I BRING A GUY HOME
AND SOON THEY'RE ALL OVER HIM.
THEY'RE LIKE COYOTES PICKING OFF THE WEAK MEMBERS OF THE HERD.
LISTEN, AS SOMEONE WHO'S SEEN MORE THAN HER SHARE OF BAD BEEF
THAT IS NOT SUCH A TERRIBLE THING.
YOUR FRIENDS ARE JUST LOOKING OUT AFTER YOU.
JUST ONCE I WISH I'D BRING A GUY HOME THEY LIKED.
WELL, YOU DO REALIZE THAT THE ODDS OF THAT HAPPENING
ARE A LITTLE SLIMMER IF THEY NEVER MEET THE GUY.
LET IT GO, ROSS.
YEAH, WELL, YOU DIDN'T KNOW CHI CHI.
Monica: DO YOU ALL PROMISE?
All: YEAH, WE PROMISE. WE'LL BE GOOD.
CHANDLER, DO YOU PROMISE?
YOU CAN COME IN BUT YOUR FILTER-TIPPED LITTLE BUDDY STAYS OUTSIDE.
Ross: HEY, PHOEBES!
"DEAR MS. BUFFAY: "THANK YOU FOR CALLING ATTENTION TO OUR ERROR.
"WE HAVE CREDITED YOUR ACCOUNT $500. "WE'RE SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE
"AND HOPE YOU'LL ACCEPT "THIS FOOTBALL PHONE...
AS OUR FREE GIFT." DO YOU BELIEVE THIS?
NOW I HAVE $1,000 AND A FOOTBALL PHONE.
WHAT BANK IS THIS?
OKAY, IT'S HIM.
WHO IS IT? Alan.
CHANDLER, HE'S HERE!
OKAY, PLEASE BE GOOD, PLEASE.
JUST REMEMBER HOW MUCH YOU LIKE ME.
HI, ALAN, THIS IS EVERYBODY. EVERYBODY, THIS IS ALAN.
HI.
All: HI, ALAN.
I'VE HEARD SCHO MUSCH ABOUT ALL YOU GUYS.
I'LL CALL YOU TOMORROW. THANK YOU.
OKAY... OKAY, LET'S LET THE ALAN-BASHING BEGIN.
WHO'S GOING TO TAKE THE FIRST SHOT? HMM?
COME ON!
I'LL GO.
LET'S START WITH THE WAY HE KEPT PICKING AT...
YOU KNOW, I'M SORRY, I CAN'T DO THIS.
WE LOVED HIM.
All: WE LOVED HIM!
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE THAT I'M GOING OUT WITH?
All: YES!
AND DID YOU NOTICE?
Men: YEAH, IT'S GREAT.
YOU KNOW WHAT WAS GREAT? HOW HIS SMILE WAS CROOKED.
YES, LIKE THE MAN IN THE SHOE.
WHAT SHOE?
FROM THE NURSERY RHYME:
"THERE WAS A CROOKED MAN WHO HAD A CROOKED SMILE
"WHO LIVED IN A SHOE FOR A... WHILE."
SO I THINK ALAN... WILL BECOME THE YARDSTICK
AGAINST WHICH ALL FUTURE BOYFRIENDS WILL BE MEASURED.
WHAT FUTURE BOYFRIENDS?
NO, I THINK THIS COULD BE...
REALLY?
I'D MARRY HIM FOR HIS DAVID HASSELHOFF IMPRESSION.
YOU KNOW I'M GOING TO BE DOING THAT AT PARTIES, RIGHT?
YOU KNOW WHAT I LIKE MOST ABOUT HIM? WHAT?
THE WAY HE MAKES ME FEEL ABOUT MYSELF.
YEAH. YEAH. YEAH. YEAH.
HI.
HOW WAS THE GAME?
WELL...
All: WE WON!
FANTASTIC! I HAVE ONE QUESTION. HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?
ALAN. HE WAS UNBELIEVABLE.
HE WAS LIKE THAT BUGS BUNNY CARTOON WHERE BUGS IS PLAYING ALL THE POSITIONS
BUT INSTEAD IT WAS FIRST BASE, ALAN; SECOND BASE, ALAN; THIRD BASE, ALAN.
I MEAN, IT WAS LIKE HE MADE US INTO A TEAM.
YEP, WE SURE SHOWED THOSE HASIDIC JEWELERS
A THING OR TWO ABOUT SOFTBALL.
CAN I ASK YOU GUYS A QUESTION?
DO YOU EVER THINK THAT ALAN IS MAYBE SOMETIMES...
I DON'T KNOW, A LITTLE TOO ALAN?
Rachel: OH, NO, THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE. ONE CAN NEVER BE TOO ALAN.
YEAH, IT'S HIS INNATE ALAN-NESS THAT WE ADORE.
I PERSONALLY COULD HAVE A GALLON OF ALAN.
HEY, LIZZY. HEY, WEIRD GIRL.
I BROUGHT YOU ALPHABET SOUP. WITHOUT THE VOWELS?
YES, BUT I LEFT IN THE "Y"s
BECAUSE YOU KNOW, "SOMETIMES Y..."
I HAVE SOMETHING ELSE. SALTINES?
NO, BUT WOULD YOU LIKE $1,000 AND A FOOTBALL PHONE?
WHAT?
OH, MY GOD!
THERE'S REALLY MONEY IN HERE. I KNOW.
WEIRD GIRL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I WANT YOU TO HAVE IT.
NO, NO, I HAVE TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING.
NO, IT'S FINE, YOU DON'T...
DO YOU WANT MY TINFOIL HAT?
NO, BECAUSE YOU NEED THAT.
PLEASE, LET ME DO SOMETHING.
OKAY, ALL RIGHT, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
YOU BUY ME A SODA, AND THEN WE'RE EVEN, OKAY?
OKAY. OKAY.
KEEP THE CHANGE.
THANKS, LIZZY. SURE YOU DON'T WANT A PRETZEL?
NO, I'M FINE, THANKS. SEE YOU.
A THUMB?
I KNOW, I KNOW, I OPENED IT UP
AND IT WAS FLOATING IN THERE LIKE THIS TINY HITCHHIKER.
MAYBE IT'S A CONTEST, LIKE, COLLECT ALL FIVE.
DOES ANYONE WANT TO SEE?
All: NO!
OH, HEY, DON'T DO THAT. PUT THAT OUT. COME ON!
IT'S WORSE THAN THE THUMB.
HEY, THIS IS SO UNFAIR.
WHY IS IT UNFAIR?
SO I HAVE A FLAW. BIG DEAL!
LIKE JOEY'S CONSTANT KNUCKLE CRACKING
ISN'T ANNOYING?
AND ROSS WHO OVERPRONOUNCES EVERY WORD;
AND MONICA WITH THAT SNORT WHEN SHE LAUGHS.
I MEAN WHAT THE HELL IS THAT THING?
I ACCEPT ALL THOSE FLAWS. WHY CAN'T YOU ACCEPT ME FOR THIS?
DOES THE KNUCKLE CRACKING BOTHER EVERYBODY?
WELL, I COULD LIVE WITHOUT IT.
OH, WELL, IS IT, LIKE, A LITTLE ANNOYING
OR IS LIKE WHEN PHOEBE CHEWS HER HAIR?
NOW, DON'T LISTEN TO HIM, PHOEBES. I THINK IT'S ENDEARING.
OH, YOU DO, DO YOU?
YOU KNOW, THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH SPEAKING CORRECTLY.
INDEED, THERE ISN'T.
I SHOULD REALLY GET BACK TO WORK.
OTHERWISE SOMEONE MIGHT GET WHAT THEY ORDERED.
Joey: OOH, WELL!
OH, HO, HO, THE HAIR COMES OUT AND THE GLOVES COME OFF.
DID YOU EVER GO OUT WITH A GUY YOUR FRIENDS ALL REALLY LIKED?
NO.
OKAY. WELL, I'M GOING OUT
WITH A GUY MY FRIENDS ALL REALLY LIKE.
WERE WE TALKING ABOUT THE COYOTES HERE?
ALL RIGHT! A COW GOT THROUGH!
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?
IT'S JUST... YOU KNOW WHAT?
I JUST DON'T FEEL THE THING.
I MEAN, THEY FEEL THE THING, I DON'T FEEL THE THING.
HONEY, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS FEEL THE THING.
IF THAT'S HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THE GUY, DUMP HIM.
I KNOW, IT'S JUST GOING TO BE REALLY HARD.
HE'S A BIG BOY, HE'LL GET OVER IT.
NO, HE'LL BE FINE. IT'S THE OTHER FIVE I'M WORRIED ABOUT.
DON'T YOU RESPECT YOUR BODY?
DON'T YOU REALIZE WHAT YOU'RE DOING?
I'VE HAD IT WITH YOU GUYS AND YOUR CANCER
AND YOUR EMPHYSEMA AND YOUR HEART DISEASE.
SMOKING IS COOL AND YOU KNOW IT.
CHANDLER... IT'S ALAN, HE WANTS TO SPEAK WITH YOU.
REALLY, HE DOES?
HEY, BUDDY, WHAT'S UP?
OH, SHE TOLD YOU ABOUT THAT, HUH?
WELL, YEAH, I HAVE ONE NOW AND THEN. WELL, YEAH, NOW.
WELL, IT'S NOT THAT...
WELL, THAT'S TRUE.
GEE, YOU KNOW, NO ONE'S... NO ONE'S EVER PUT IT LIKE THAT BEFORE.
SO, WELL, OKAY, THANKS.
GOD, HE'S GOOD.
IF ONLY HE WERE A WOMAN.
YEAH.
And Lamb Chop and Hush Puppy...
HOW OLD IS THAT SOCK?
IF I HAD A SOCK ON MY HAND FOR 30 YEARS IT'D BE TALKING, TOO.
OKAY, I THINK IT'S TIME TO CHANGE SOMEBODY'S NICOTINE PATCH.
HEY!
WHERE'S JOEY?
JOEY ATE MY LAST STICK OF GUM SO I KILLED HIM.
DO YOU THINK THAT WAS WRONG?
HE'S ACROSS THE HALL. THANKS.
THERE YOU GO.
OOH, I'M ALIVE WITH PLEASURE NOW.

HEY, I MIGHT.
SORRY.
YOU KNOW, THOSE STUPID SODA PEOPLE GAVE ME $7,000 FOR THE THUMB.
$7,000?
AND ON MY WAY OVER HERE
I STEPPED IN GUM.
WHAT IS UP WITH THE UNIVERSE?
WHAT'S GOING ON?
NOTHING, I JUST THINK IT'S NICE WHEN WE'RE ALL HERE TOGETHER.
NICER WHEN EVERYONE GETS TO WEAR THEIR UNDERWEAR.
UH, JOEY.
OH.
OH, OKAY.
( protestations )
PLEASE, GUYS WE HAVE TO TALK.
WAIT, WAIT. I'M GETTING A DEJA VU.
NO, I'M NOT.
ALL RIGHT, WE HAVE TO TALK. THERE IT IS!
OKAY, IT'S ABOUT ALAN.

I MEAN, THERE'S REALLY NO EASY WAY TO SAY THIS.
I'VE DECIDED TO BREAK UP WITH ALAN.
IS THERE SOMEBODY ELSE?
NO, NO, NO, NO, IT'S JUST...
YOU KNOW, THINGS CHANGE, PEOPLE CHANGE.
WE DIDN'T CHANGE.
SO THAT'S IT? IT'S OVER?
JUST LIKE THAT?
YOU KNOW, YOU LET YOUR GUARD DOWN
YOU KNOW, YOU START TO REALLY CARE ABOUT SOMEONE AND I JUST... I...
LOOK, I CAN GO ON PRETENDING... OKAY.
NO. IT WOULDN'T BE FAIR TO ALAN, OR TO YOU.
YEAH, WELL, WHO WANTS FAIR?
I MEAN, I JUST WANT THINGS BACK YOU KNOW, THE WAY THEY WERE.
I'M SORRY. OH, SHE'S SORRY. I FEEL BETTER.
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
I MEAN, WITH THE HOLIDAYS COMING UP. I WANTED HIM TO MEET MY FAMILY.
I'LL MEET SOMEONE ELSE. THERE'LL BE OTHER ALANS.
OH, YEAH, RIGHT.
WILL YOU GUYS BE OKAY? HEY, HEY, WE'LL BE FINE.
WE'RE JUST GOING TO NEED A LITTLE TIME.
I UNDERSTAND.
I'M REALLY SORRY. YEAH. I'M SORRY, TOO.
BUT I GOT TO TELL YOU, I AM A LITTLE RELIEVED.
RELIEVED?
WELL, I MEAN, I HAD A GREAT TIME WITH YOU...
I JUST CAN'T STAND YOUR FRIENDS.
REMEMBER WHEN WE WENT TO CENTRAL PARK AND RENTED BOATS?
THAT WAS FUN.
YEAH. HE COULD ROW LIKE A VIKING.
( all mumble )
SO HOW DID IT GO?
UH... YOU KNOW. DID... DID HE MENTION US?
HE SAYS HE'S REALLY GOING TO MISS YOU GUYS.
YOU HAD A ROUGH DAY, HUH?
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.
THAT'S IT, I'M GETTING CIGARETTES.
All: NO, NO, NO!
I DON'T CARE.
GAME'S OVER, I'M WEAK. I MUST HAVE THE SMOKE.
Phoebe: IF YOU NEVER SMOKE AGAIN I'LL GIVE YOU $7,000.
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
LOOK AT THAT.
I KNOW.
ISN'T THAT AMAZING?
WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO BE SEEING HERE?
I DON'T KNOW, BUT I THINK IT'S ABOUT
TO ATTACK THE ENTERPRISE.
IF YOU TILT YOUR HEAD TO THE LEFT AND RELAX YOUR EYES
IT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE AN OLD POTATO.
THEN DON'T DO THAT, ALL RIGHT? OKAY.
MONICA.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
ARE YOU WELLING UP?
NO.
YOU ARE. YOU'RE WELLING UP. NO, I'M NOT.
YOU'LL BE AN AUNT. ( sobbing ): SHUT UP.
HI, MINDY.
HI, I-IT'S RACHEL.
YEAH, I'M FINE. I-I SAW BARRY TODAY.
UH, YEAH, HE TOLD ME.
NO. NO, IT'S OKAY.
REALLY, IT'S OKAY.
I HOPE YOU TWO ARE VERY HAPPY, I REALLY DO.
UH, OH, AND MIN, YOU KNOW
IF EVERYTHING WORKS OUT AND YOU GUYS
END UP GETTING MARRIED AND HAVING KIDS AND EVERYTHING...
I HOPE THEY HAVE HIS OLD HAIRLINE AND YOUR OLD NOSE.
OKAY, I KNOW IT WAS A CHEAP SHOT BUT I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER NOW.




WILL YOU LET IT GO?
IT'S NOT THAT BIG A DEAL.
IT'S AMAZING, OKAY?
YOU JUST REACH IN THERE
THERE'S ONE LITTLE MANEUVER
AND BAM, A BRA, RIGHT OUT THE SLEEVE.
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED
THERE IS NOTHING A GUY CAN DO THAT EVEN COMES CLOSE.
Rachel: OH, COME ON! YOU GUYS CAN PEE STANDING UP.
WE CAN? OKAY, I'M TRYING THAT.
YOU KNOW WHAT BLOWS MY MIND?
WOMEN CAN SEE BREASTS ANYTIME THEY WANT.
YOU JUST LOOK DOWN, AND THERE THEY ARE.
HOW YOU GET ANY WORK DONE IS BEYOND ME.
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT I DON'T GET?
THE WAY GUYS CAN DO SO MANY MEAN THINGS AND THEN NOT EVEN CARE.
MULTIPLE ORGASMS.
SO, SATURDAY NIGHT, THE BIG NIGHT
DATE NIGHT, SATURDAY NIGHT, SA-TUR-DAY NIGHT!
NO PLANS, HUH? NOT A ONE.
NOT EVEN, SAY, BREAKING UP WITH JANICE?
OH, RIGHT, RIGHT.
SHUT UP.
CHANDLER, NOBODY LIKES BREAKING UP WITH SOMEONE.
YOU JUST GOT TO DO IT. I KNOW, BUT IT'S JUST SO HARD, YOU KNOW?
I MEAN, YOU'RE SITTING THERE WITH HER.
SHE HAS NO IDEA WHAT'S HAPPENING.
YOU FINALLY GET UP THE COURAGE TO DO IT
AND THERE'S THAT HORRIBLE AWKWARD MOMENT
WHEN YOU'VE HANDED HER THE NOTE...
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BREAK UP WITH HER?
BE A MAN. JUST STOP CALLING.
IF YOU WANT, I'LL DO IT WITH YOU.
I THINK SHE'D FEEL LIKE WE'RE GANGING UP ON HER.
NO, I MEAN, YOU BREAK UP WITH JANICE AND I'LL BREAK UP WITH TONY.
YOU'RE BREAKING UP WITH TONY?
YEAH, I KNOW HE'S SWEET, BUT IT'S JUST NOT FUN ANYMORE.
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S ME OR HIS HUNGER STRIKE, OR...
DOES ANYBODY WANT ANYTHING ELSE? OH, YEAH.
LAST WEEK YOU HAD A WONDERFUL NUTTY, CHOCOLATY KIND OF A CAKEY PIE-THING...
NOTHING. JUST, JUST... I'M FINE.
WHAT'S THE MATTER? WHY SO SCRUNCHY?
OH, IT'S MY FATHER. HE WANTS TO GIVE ME A MERCEDES CONVERTIBLE.
THAT GUY... HE BURNS ME UP.
YEAH, WELL, IT'S A MERCEDES IF I MOVE BACK HOME.
UGH, IT'S HORRIBLE! HE CALLED ME "YOUNG LADY."
I HATE WHEN MY FATHER CALLS ME THAT.
THAT "YOU'RE NOT UP TO THIS" THING AGAIN?
OH, YEAH. I ACTUALLY GOT THE EXTENDED DISCO VERSION
WITH THREE CHORUSES OF "YOU'LL NEVER MAKE IT ON YOUR OWN."
HI, JOEY.
OH, MY GOD-- ANGELA.
WOW. BEING DUMPED BY YOU OBVIOUSLY AGREES WITH HER.
ARE YOU GOING TO GO OVER THERE?
NO. YEAH. NO.
I DON'T WANT TO SEEM TOO EAGER.
ONE-MISSISSIPPI, TWO-MISSISSIPPI
THREE-MISSISSIPPI... THAT SEEMS PRETTY COOL.
HEY, ANGELA.
JOEY.
YOU LOOK GOOD.
THAT'S 'CAUSE I'M WEARING A DRESS THAT ACCENTS MY BOOBS.
YOU DON'T SAY.
SO, RACHEL WHAT ARE YOU... WHAT ARE YOU DOING TONIGHT?
OH, BIG GLAMOUR NIGHT ME AND MONICA AT LAUNDERAMA.
OH. YOU, UH... YOU WANT TO HEAR A FREAKISH COINCIDENCE?
GUESS WHO'S DOING LAUNDRY THERE TOO?
ME.
WAS THAT NOT CLEAR?
UH, HEY, WHY DON'T, UH...
WHY DON'T I JUST JOIN YOU... BOTH... THERE?
DON'T YOU HAVE A LAUNDRY ROOM IN YOUR BUILDING?
YES.
I DO HAVE A LAUNDRY ROOM IN MY BUILDING.
UH, BUT THERE'S A RAT PROBLEM.
THEY'RE ATTRACTED TO THE DRYER SHEETS
AND THEY'RE GOING IN FINE
BUT THEY'RE COMING OUT ALL...
FLUFFY.
ANYWAY, SAY, SEVEN-ISH?
SURE.
FORGET IT, JOEY. I'M WITH BOB NOW.
BOB? MM-HMM. WHO THE HELL'S BOB?
BOB IS GREAT.
HE'S SMART, HE'S SOPHISTICATED
AND HE HAS A REAL JOB.
YOU, YOU GO ON THREE AUDITIONS A MONTH
AND YOU CALL YOURSELF AN ACTOR
BUT BOB... COME ON.
WE WERE GREAT TOGETHER
AND NOT JUST AT THE FUN STUFF BUT, LIKE, TALKING TOO.
YEAH, WELL, SORRY, JOE. YOU SAID "LET'S JUST BE FRIENDS"
SO GUESS WHAT?
WHAT?
WE'RE JUST FRIENDS.
FINE. FINE. SO, WHY DON'T THE FOUR OF US
GO OUT AND HAVE DINNER TOGETHER TONIGHT-- YOU KNOW, AS FRIENDS?
WHAT FOUR OF US?
WELL, YOU KNOW, YOU AND BOB AND ME AND MY GIRLFRIEND, UH... UH...
MONICA.
I'M TELLING YOU THIS GUY IS PERFECT FOR YOU.
FORGET IT.
NOT AFTER YOUR COUSIN WHO COULD BELCH THE ALPHABET.
THIS GUY'S GREAT. HIS NAME'S BOB.
HE'S ANGELA'S... BROTHER.
HE'S SMART, HE'S
SOPHISTICATED, AND HE HAS A REAL JOB.
ME, I GO ON THREE AUDITIONS A MONTH
AND CALL MYSELF AN ACTOR, BUT BOB IS...
OH, GOD HELP US. WHAT?
UGLY NAKED GUYS LAYING KITCHEN TILE.
LOOK, I'M ASKING A FAVOR HERE. YOU KNOW, I'M THINKING
IF I DO THIS THING FOR HER BROTHER
MAYBE ANGELA WILL COME BACK TO ME.
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? YOU GO OUT WITH TONS OF GIRLS.
I KNOW, BUT...
LOOK, I MADE A HUGE MISTAKE. I NEVER SHOULD HAVE BROKE UP WITH HER.
WILL YOU HELP ME? PLEASE?
OKAY. BYE.
WELL, MONICA'S NOT COMING. IT'S JUST GOING TO BE ME AND RACHEL.
WELL, HOLD ON THERE, CAMPER. YOU SURE YOU'VE THOUGHT THIS THROUGH?
IT'S LAUNDRY. THE THINKING THROUGH IS PRETTY MINIMAL.
SEE, IT'S JUST YOU AND RACHEL, JUST THE TWO OF YOU?
THIS IS A DATE. YOU'RE GOING ON A DATE.
N'UH-UH.
Y'UH-HUH.
I SHOULD SHAVE AGAIN, PICK UP SOME WINE? WHAT?
WELL, YOU, UH, MAY WANT TO RETHINK THE DIRTY UNDERWEAR.
THIS IS BASICALLY THE FIRST TIME SHE'S GOING TO SEE YOUR UNDERWEAR. DO YOU WANT IT TO BE DIRTY?
NO.
OH, AND, UH, THE FABRIC SOFTENER?
OKAY, OKAY, NOW, WHAT IS WRONG WITH MY SNUGGLES?
IT, WHAT? IT SAYS I'M A SENSITIVE, WARM KIND OF GUY
YOU KNOW, LIKE A LITTLE FUZZY BEAR.
I CAN GET SOMETHING ELSE. THERE YOU GO.
THANK YOU.
SO, WHAT DOES THIS BOB GUY LOOK LIKE? IS HE TALL, SHORT?
YUP.
WHICH?
WHICH WHAT?
YOU'VE NEVER MET BOB, HAVE YOU?
NO, BUT HE'S...
OH, MY GOD, JOEY THIS GUY COULD BE HORRIBLY...
HEY, JOEY!
HORRIBLY ATTRACTIVE. I'LL BE SHUTTING UP NOW.
WHERE ARE THEY? WHERE ARE THEY?
THIS IS NICE. WE NEVER DO ANYTHING JUST THE TWO OF US.
IT'S GREAT. MAYBE TOMORROW WE CAN RENT A CAR
I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.
HERE WE GO. OKAY, HAVE A GOOD BREAK-UP.
HEY, JANICE. OH, MY GOD I AM SO GLAD YOU CALLED ME.
I HAD THE MOST SUPREMELY AWFUL DAY.
HEY, THAT'S NOT GOOD.
CAN I GET AN ESPRESSO AND A LATTE OVER HERE, PLEASE?
WE GOT THE PROOFS BACK FROM THAT PHOTO SHOOT--
THE ONE WITH THE LITTLE VEGETABLES--
THEY PRETTY MUCH SUCKED
SO I BLEW OFF THE REST OF THE AFTERNOON.
I WENT SHOPPING, AND I GOT YOU...
I'M LOOKING, I'M LOOKING...
I'M LOOKING...
I GOT YOU... WHAT?!
WHAT? WHAT... DID YOU GET ME THERE?
I GOT YOU...
THESE.
BULLWINKLE SOCKS.
THAT'S SO SWEET. I KNEW YOU HAD THE ROCKYS
SO YOU COULD WEAR BULLWINKLE AND BULLWINKLE
OR YOU COULD WEAR ROCKY AND ROCKY OR YOU CAN MIX AND MATCH.
MOOSE AND SQUIRREL.
WHATEVER YOU WANT.
WELL, I'M GOING TO GET ANOTHER ESPRESSO. MORE LATTE?
NO... NO, I-I'M, I'M STILL WORKING ON MINE.
THAT'S IT?
YEAH, IT WAS REALLY HARD.
OH, YEAH, THE HUG LOOKED PRETTY BRUTAL.
OKAY, YOU WEREN'T THERE.
Woman: COMING THROUGH. MOVE, MOVE.
I WAS KIND OF USING THAT MACHINE.
YEAH, WELL, NOW YOU'RE KIND OF NOT.
I-I PUT MY BASKET ON TOP.
OH, I'M SORRY, IS THAT YOUR BASKET?
YES.
IT'S REALLY PRETTY. UNFORTUNATELY, I DON'T SEE SUDS!
WHAT?
NO SUDS, NO SAVE. OKAY?
WHAT'S GOING ON?
HI. UH, NOTHING. THIS HORRIBLE WOMAN JUST TOOK MY MACHINE.
WAS YOUR BASKET ON TOP?
YEAH, BUT THERE WERE NO SUDS. SO?
YOU KNOW, "NO SUDS, NO SAVE."
NO SUDS, NO..? EXCUSE ME.
HOLD ON A SECOND.
THIS IS MY FRIEND'S MACHINE.
HEY, HEY, HEY, HER STUFF WASN'T IN IT.
HEY, HEY, HEY, THAT'S NOT THE RULE AND YOU KNOW IT.
ALL RIGHT, SHOW'S OVER.
NOTHING TO SEE HERE.
OKAY, LET'S DO LAUNDRY.
THAT WAS AMAZING.
WELL...
I CAN'T EVEN SEND BACK SOUP.
WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE SUCH A SWEET, GENTLE, UH...
UM, UH, DO YOU, UH, OH, HEY
YOU MUST NEED DETERGENT. OH!
UBERWEISS. IT'S NEW, IT'S GERMAN
IT'S EXTRA-TOUGH.
RACH, ARE YOU GOING TO SEPARATE THOSE?
OH, GOD. OH!
AM I BEING, LIKE A TOTAL LAUNDRY SPAZ?
I MEAN, AM I SUPPOSED TO USE ONE MACHINE FOR SHIRTS
AND ANOTHER MACHINE FOR PANTS?
HAVE YOU..? HAVE YOU NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE?
WELL, NOT MYSELF BUT I KNOW OTHER PEOPLE THAT HAVE.
OKAY, YOU CAUGHT ME. I'M A LAUNDRY VIRGIN.
UH, WELL, DON'T WORRY, I'LL USE THE GENTLE CYCLE.
OKAY, UH...
BASICALLY, YOU WANT TO USE ONE MACHINE
FOR ALL YOUR WHITES
A WHOLE NOTHER MACHINE FOR, FOR YOUR COLORS
AND, AND A THIRD FOR YOUR, UH...
UH... DELICATES, AND THAT WOULD BE
YOUR BRAS AND YOUR UNDER... PANTY-THINGS.
OKAY, WELL, WHAT ABOUT...
THESE ARE WHITE COTTON PANTIES.
WOULD THEY GO WITH WHITES
OR WITH DELICATES?
UH, THAT, THAT... THAT WOULD BE A JUDGMENT CALL.
SO, WHERE DID YOU GUYS GROW UP?
BROOKLYN HEIGHTS. CLEVELAND.
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN? OH, MY GOD!
WHAT?
I, UH, SUDDENLY HAD THE FEELING
I WAS... FALLING.
BUT I'M NOT.
SO, YOU AND ANGELA, HUH?
YEP. PRETTY MUCH.
YOU'RE A LUCKY MAN. YEAH.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MISS THE MOST ABOUT HER?
THAT CUTE NIBBLY NOISE SHE MAKES WHEN SHE EATS
LIKE A HAPPY LITTLE SQUIRREL OR...
OR A WEASEL.
I... I NEVER REALLY NOTICED.
OH, YEAH, YEAH. LISTEN FOR IT.
MONICA... MONICA IS GREAT.
YEAH. YEAH, SHE IS.
BUT, UH... IT'S NOT GOING TO LAST.
SHE'S TOO MUCH FOR ME IN BED.
SEXUALLY.
I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU. BOB IS TERRIFIC.
YEAH. ISN'T HE?
IT IS SO GREAT TO MEET A GUY WHO'S SMART AND FUNNY
AND HAS AN EMOTIONAL AGE BEYOND, LIKE, EIGHT.
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE? HE'S UNBELIEVABLE IN BED.
MY BROTHER NEVER EVEN TOLD ME WHEN HE LOST HIS VIRGINITY.
THAT'S NICE.
YOU CAN DO THIS.
IT'S JUST LIKE PULLING OFF A BAND-AID.
JUST DO IT REALLY FAST AND THEN THE WOUND IS EXPOSED.
GO. GO.
JANICE...
HI, JANICE.
OKAY, HERE WE GO: I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD GO OUT ANYMORE.
JANICE.
ALL RIGHT.
WELL...
WELL, THERE YOU GO.
STOP IT. STOP IT. STOP IT.
OKAY. I KNOW THIS IS GOING TO SOUND REALLY STUPID
BUT I FEEL... I FEEL THAT IF I CAN DO THIS...
YOU KNOW, IF I CAN ACTUALLY DO MY OWN LAUNDRY
THERE ISN'T ANYTHING I CAN'T DO.
THAT DOES NOT SOUND STUPID TO ME.
LIKE THE FIRST TIME I HAD TO MAKE DINNER FOR MYSELF AFTER CAROL LEFT ME. ( buzzing )
THAT'S ALL THE TIME WE HAVE. NEXT, ON ROSS...
OKAY. UH-OH.
WHAT "UH-OH"?
UH-OH...
UH-OH... THE LAUNDRY'S DONE.
IT'S A... IT'S A SONG.
THE LAUNDRY SONG THAT WE SING.
‚ô™ UH-OH, THE LAUNDRY'S DONE. ‚ô™ ROSS, WHAT'S THE MATTER?
NOTHING.
‚ô™ LEE-LO, THE LAUNDRY'S DONE. ‚ô™
COME ON. SHOW ME.
IT'S JUST THAT YOU LEFT A RED SOCK IN WITH ALL YOUR WHITES AND NOW...
EVERYTHING'S KIND OF PINK.
YEAH.
EXCEPT FOR THE RED SOCK, WHICH IS STILL RED.
IT COULD HAPPEN TO ANYONE.
BUT IT DIDN'T. IT HAPPENED TO ME.
GOD! I'M GOING TO LOOK LIKE A BIG MARSHMALLOW PEEP.
WHAT AM I DOING? WHAT AM I DOING?
MY FATHER'S RIGHT. I CAN'T LIVE ON MY OWN.
I CAN'T EVEN DO LAUNDRY.
SOMETHING WENT WRONG WITH UNDERDOG
AND THEY COULDN'T GET HIS HEAD TO INFLATE
SO, ANYWAY, UM...
HIS HEAD IS, LIKE, FLOPPING DOWN BROADWAY, RIGHT?
AND I'M JUST THINKING...
HOW INAPPROPRIATE THIS IS.
UM... I'VE GOT SOMETHING IN MY EYE.
JOEY, COULD WE CHECK IT IN THE LIGHT?
WHAT?
HELLO?! WERE WE AT THE SAME TABLE?
IT'S LIKE COCKTAILS IN APPALACHIA.
COME ON. THEY'RE CLOSE. CLOSE? SHE'S GOT HER TONGUE IN HIS EAR.
OH. LIKE YOU'VE NEVER GOTTEN A LITTLE RAMBUNCTIOUS WITH ROSS?
JOEY, THIS IS SICK. IT'S DISGUSTING.
NOT REALLY TRUE, IS IT?
WHO'S TO SAY WHAT'S TRUE? WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?
ALL RIGHT, LOOK. I'M NOT PROUD OF THIS.
WELL, MAYBE I AM A LITTLE. OH!
I'M OUT OF HERE. WAIT. WAIT. WAIT.
YOU LIKE HIM. I WANT HER.
HE LIKES YOU.
REALLY? YEAH.
I'M THINKING IF WE PUT OUR HEADS TOGETHER
BETWEEN THE TWO OF US WE CAN BREAK THEM UP.
I'M SO SORRY. I CAN'T BELIEVE I DID THIS.
I JUST COULDN'T STOP LAUGHING AT YOUR NORMAN MAILER STORY
WAITER, ONE MORE PLATE OF CHICKEN WINGS.
HERE'S THE THING, JANICE, WE'RE DIFFERENT.
I'M LIKE THE BING, BING, BING. YOU'RE LIKE THE BOOM, BOOM, BOOM.
MY GOD! I'M SO SORRY.
ARE YOU OKAY?
IT'S JUST MY LENS.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
I HIT HER IN THE EYE. I HIT HER IN THE EYE!
THIS IS THE WORST BREAKUP IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD.
OH, MY GOD.
HOW MANY OF THOSE HAVE YOU HAD?
I DON'T KNOW. A MILLION?
CHANDLER, SHH. EASY. EASY. GO TO YOUR HAPPY PLACE.
I'M FINE. I'M NOT FINE.
HERE SHE COMES.
JUST WAIT HERE, OKAY? BREATHE.
HOW DO YOU DO THAT?
IT'S LIKE A GIFT.
WE SHOULD ALWAYS, ALWAYS BREAK UP TOGETHER.
OH, I'D LIKE THAT.
YOU GOT THE CLOTHES CLEAN. NOW, THAT'S THE IMPORTANT PART.
OH, I GUESS.
EXCEPT EVERYTHING LOOKS LIKE JAMMIES NOW.
OH, I'M SORRY.
EXCUSE ME. WE HAD THIS CART.
YEAH, WELL, I HAD A 24-INCH WAIST. YOU LOSE THINGS.
NOW, COME ON. GET OUT OF MY WAY.
MAYBE I WASN'T BEING CLEAR. THIS WAS OUR CART.
THERE WEREN'T ANY CLOTHES IN IT!
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY! QUIT MAKING UP RULES!
LET GO!
( arguing )
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN, MITZI. IF YOU WANT THIS CART
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE ME WITH IT.
YES.
DID YOU SEE THAT?
YOU WERE INCREDIBLE.
A BRAND-NEW WOMAN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
I COULD NOT HAVE DONE THIS WITHOUT YOU.
OKAY, UM... UH...
MORE CLOTHES IN THE DRYER?
I'M FINE. I'M FINE. ARE YOU SURE?
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY? YEAH.
DOES IT STILL HURT?
WHAT A NEAT IDEA.
ALL YOUR CLOTHES MATCH.
HI. HEY. HOW DID IT GO?
EXCELLENT.
WE RIPPED THAT COUPLE APART AND KEPT THE PIECES FOR OURSELVES.
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL STORY.
HEY. I'M FINE, BY THE WAY.
OH, I'M...
HEY. WHERE'S CHANDLER? HE NEEDED SOME TIME TO GRIEVE.
I'M FREE! I'M FREE!
THAT OUGHT TO DO IT.




EVERYBODY? SHH, SHH. CENTRAL PERK IS PROUD TO PRESENT
THE MUSIC OF MISS PHOEBE BUFFAY!
HI. I WANT TO START WITH A SONG THAT'S ABOUT THAT MOMENT
WHEN YOU SUDDENLY REALIZE WHAT LIFE IS REALLY ALL ABOUT.
OKAY. HERE WE GO.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WHAT THE..?
OH, GREAT. THIS IS JUST...
WOW, THIS IS SO COOL.
THE ENTIRE CITY IS BLACKED OUT.
MOM SAYS IT'S ALL OF MANHATTAN, PARTS OF BROOKLYN AND QUEENS, AND THEY HAVE NO IDEA
WHEN IT'S COMING BACK ON.
WOW. YOU GUYS, THIS IS BIG.
PANTS AND A SWEATER? WHY, MOM?
WHO AM I GOING TO MEET IN A BLACKOUT--
POWER COMPANY GUYS? ELIGIBLE LOOTERS?
CAN WE TALK ABOUT THIS LATER? OKAY.
CAN I BORROW THE PHONE?
I WANT TO CALL MY APARTMENT
AND CHECK ON MY GRANDMA. SURE.
WHAT'S MY NUMBER?
WELL, I NEVER CALL ME.
OH, MY GOD. IT'S HER.
IT'S THAT VICTORIA'S SECRET MODEL--
SOMETHING "GOODACRE."
HI, MOM. IT'S JILL.
SHE'S RIGHT. IT'S JILL, JILL GOODACRE.
OH, MY GOD.
I AM TRAPPED IN AN A.T.M. VESTIBULE WITH JILL GOODACRE.
IS IT A VESTIBULE? MAYBE IT'S AN ATRIUM.
YEAH. THAT IS THE PART TO FOCUS ON, YOU IDIOT.
YEAH, I'M FINE. I'M STUCK AT THE BANK IN AN A.T.M. VESTIBULE.
JILL SAYS "VESTIBULE."
I'M GOING WITH "VESTIBULE."
I'M FINE.
NO, I'M NOT ALONE.
SOME GUY.
OH! "SOME GUY." I AM "SOME GUY."
"HEY, JILL, I SAW YOU WITH SOME GUY LAST NIGHT.
YES. HE WAS SOME GUY."
HI, EVERYONE.
AND OFFICIATING AT TONIGHT'S BLACKOUT IS RABBI TRIBBIANI.
WELL, CHANDLER'S OLD ROOMMATE WAS JEWISH,
AND THESE ARE OUR ONLY CANDLES.
SO, HAPPY HANUKKAH, EVERYONE.
EWW, LOOK. UGLY NAKED GUY LIT A BUNCH OF CANDLES.
OH, THAT HAD TO HURT!
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. IT'S BEEN 14 1/2 MINUTES
AND YOU STILL HAVE NOT SAID ONE WORD.
OH, GOD. DO SOMETHING.
JUST MAKE CONTACT. SMILE.
THERE YOU GO.
YOU'RE DEFINITELY SCARING HER.
UH, WOULD YOU LIKE TO CALL SOMEBODY?
YEAH. ABOUT 300 GUYS I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL WITH.
YEAH, THANKS.
HELLO. HEY, IT'S ME.
IT'S CHANDLER. ARE YOU OKAY?
YEAH, I'M FINE.
( mumbling ): I'M STUCK IN AN A.T.M. VESTIBULE
WITH JILL GOODACRE.
WHAT?!
( mumbling ): I'M STUCK IN AN A.T.M. VESTIBULE
WITH JILL GOODACRE.
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU SAID.
PUT JOEY ON THE PHONE.
WHAT'S UP, MAN?
( mumbling ): I'M STUCK...
IN AN A.T.M. VESTIBULE
WITH JILL GOODACRE.
OH, MY GOD!
HE'S TRAPPED IN AN A.T.M. VESTIBULE WITH JILL GOODACRE!
CHANDLER, LISTEN, LISTEN!
YEAH, LIKE THAT THOUGHT NEVER ENTERED MY MIND.
Rachel: OKAY, SOMEBODY, SOMEBODY.
I'LL GO, I'LL GO.
SENIOR YEAR OF COLLEGE ON A POOL TABLE.
POOL TABLE! OOH-HOO!
THAT'S MY SISTER.
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.
MY WEIRDEST PLACE WOULD HAVE TO BE...
THE WOMEN'S ROOM ON THE SECOND FLOOR OF THE NEW YORK CITY PUBLIC LIBRARY.
OH, MY GOD. WHAT WERE YOU DOING IN A LIBRARY?
HEY, PHEEBS, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
OH, UM, MILWAUKEE.
UM, ROSS?
DISNEYLAND, 1989-- "IT'S A SMALL WORLD AFTER ALL."
NO WAY.
YEAH, THE RIDE BROKE DOWN
SO CAROL AND I WENT BEHIND A COUPLE OF THOSE MECHANICAL DUTCH CHILDREN.
THEY FIXED THE RIDE AND WE WERE ASKED NEVER TO RETURN TO THE MAGIC KINGDOM.
OOH, RACHEL?
COME ON, I ALREADY WENT.
YOU DID NOT. YES, I DID.
COME ON.
ALL RIGHT, UH... THE WEIRDEST PLACE WOULD HAVE TO BE
OH... THE FOOT OF THE BED.
STEP BACK. WE HAVE A WINNER.
I'VE NEVER HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH THAT KIND OF PASSION
WHERE YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOMEBODY RIGHT THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF A THEME PARK.
WELL, IT WAS THE ONLY THING TO DO THERE THAT DIDN'T HAVE A LINE.
WELL, SEE? BARRY WOULDN'T EVEN KISS ME ON A MINIATURE GOLF COURSE.
COME ON.
NO. HE SAID WE WERE HOLDING UP THE PEOPLE BEHIND US.
AND YOU DIDN'T MARRY HIM BECAUSE...
DO YOU THINK THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT GO THROUGH LIFE
NEVER HAVING THAT KIND OF..?
PROBABLY. REALLY?
BUT I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING-- PASSION IS WAY OVERRATED.
YEAH, RIGHT.
IT IS. EVENTUALLY, IT KIND OF BURNS OUT
BUT, HOPEFULLY WHAT YOU'RE LEFT WITH IS TRUST AND SECURITY
AND, WELL, IN THE CASE
OF MY EX-WIFE, LESBIANISM.
SO FOR ALL THOSE WHO MISS OUT ON THAT PASSION THING
THERE'S ALL THAT OTHER GOOD STUFF.
OKAY.
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT WILL BE YOU.
HMM.
SEE, I SEE, UH... BIG PASSION IN YOUR FUTURE.
REALLY? MM-HMM.
YOU DO? I DO.
OH, ROSS, YOU'RE SO GREAT.
IT'S NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN.
WHAT? YOU AND RACHEL.
WHY NOT?
BECAUSE YOU WAITED TOO LONG TO MAKE YOUR MOVE
AND NOW YOU'RE IN "THE FRIEND ZONE."
NO, NO, NO, I'M NOT IN THE ZONE.
NO. ROSS, YOU'RE MAYOR OF THE ZONE.
LOOK, I'M TAKING MY TIME, ALL RIGHT?
I'M LAYING THE GROUNDWORK.
YEAH, EVERY DAY, I GET JUST A LITTLE BIT CLOSER TO...
PRIESTHOOD.
ROSS, I'M TELLING YOU, SHE HAS NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.
IF YOU DON'T ASK HER OUT SOON YOU'LL END UP STUCK IN THE ZONE FOREVER.
I WILL, I WILL.
I'M JUST... SEE, I'M WAITING FOR THE, UH... THE RIGHT MOMENT.
WHAT?
WHAT? NOW? DUH..!
WHAT'S MESSING YOU UP?
THE WINE, THE CANDLES, THE MOONLIGHT, HUH?
JUST GO UP TO HER AND SAY, "LOOK, RACHEL..."
SHH-SHH-SHH!
WHAT ARE WE SHUSHING?
WE'RE SHUSHING BECAUSE... WE'RE TRYING TO HEAR SOMETHING.
WHAT?
DON'T YOU HEAR THAT?
SEE?
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME GUM? OH, IS IT SUGARLESS?
NO. SORRY, IT'S NOT. THEN, NO THANKS.
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?
IF JILL GOODACRE OFFERS YOU GUM, YOU TAKE IT.
IF SHE OFFERS YOU MANGLED ANIMAL CARCASS, YOU TAKE IT.
Phoebe: ‚ô™ NEW YORK CITY HAS NO POWER ‚ô™
‚ô™ AND THE MILK IS GETTING SOUR ‚ô™
‚ô™ BUT TO ME IT IS NOT SCARY ‚ô™
‚ô™ 'CAUSE I STAY AWAY FROM DAIRY... ‚ô™
OKAY, HERE GOES.
YOU GONNA DO IT? I'M GONNA DO IT.

YOU COME OUT THERE YOU'RE A DEAD MAN.
ROSS...
GOOD LUCK, MAN.
THANKS.
OKAY.
WHERE YOU GOING? OUTSIDE.
YOU CAN'T GO OUT THERE. WHY NOT?
BECAUSE OF, UH... THE REASON.
AND THAT WOULD BE?
I, UH... I CAN'T TELL YOU. JOEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?
OKAY, LISTEN, YOU GOT TO PROMISE YOU'LL NEVER, EVER TELL ROSS THAT I TOLD YOU.
ABOUT WHAT? HE'S PLANNING YOUR BIRTHDAY PARTY.
OH, MY GOD, I LOVE HIM.
AND YOU BETTER ACT SURPRISED.
ABOUT WHAT? MY SURPRISE PARTY.
WHAT SURPRISE PARTY? OH, STOP IT. JOEY ALREADY TOLD ME.
WELL, HE DIDN'T TELL ME.
HEY, DON'T LOOK AT ME. THIS IS ROSS'S THING.
THIS IS SO TYPICAL. I'M THE LAST ONE TO KNOW EVERYTHING.
YOU ARE NOT. WE TELL YOU STUFF.
YUH-HUH. I WAS THE LAST TO KNOW WHEN CHANDLER GOT BIT BY THE PEACOCK AT THE ZOO.
LAST TO KNOW YOU HAD A CRUSH ON JOEY WHEN HE WAS MOVING IN.
WHAT?
OH, LOOKS LIKE I WAS SECOND TO LAST.
MMM, SO NICE.
HEY, I HAVE A QUESTION.
WELL, ACTUALLY, IT'S NOT SO MUCH A QUESTION
AS MORE OF A GENERAL WONDERING... MENT.
OKAY. OKAY.
UH, HERE GOES.
UM, WELL, FOR A WHILE NOW, I'VE BEEN WANTING TO, UM...
OH... YES, YES.
OH, WOOK AT THE WIDDLE KITTY.
WHAT?
‚ô™ ...TOP OF THE WORLD LOOKING ‚ô™ ‚ô™ DOWN ON CREATION ‚ô™
‚ô™ AND THE ONLY EXPLANATION I CAN FIND ‚ô™
‚ô™ IS THE LOVE THAT I'VE FOUND ‚ô™ ‚ô™ EVER SINCE YOU'VE BEEN AROUND... ‚ô™
THIS IS JUST BACTINE. IT WON'T HURT.
SORRY. THAT WAS WAX.
THIS POOR LITTLE TOOTY IS SCARED TO DEATH. WE SHOULD FIND HIS OWNER.
LET'S PUT THE POOR LITTLE TOOTY IN THE HALL.
DURING A BLACKOUT? SHE'LL GET TRAMPLED.
YEAH..?
ON SECOND THOUGHT, GUM WOULD BE PERFECTION.
"GUM WOULD BE PERFECTION"?
"GUM WOULD BE PERFECTION."
COULD HAVE SAID, "GUM WOULD BE NICE." COULD HAVE SAID, "I'LL HAVE A STICK."
BUT NO, NO, NO, NO, FOR ME GUM IS PERFECTION.
I LOATHE MYSELF.
OH, NO. THE MELLMANS. THEY HATE ALL LIVING THINGS.
HI. WE JUST FOUND THIS CAT. WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE OWNER.
UM, YEAH, IT'S, UH, IT'S MINE.
IT SEEMS TO HATE YOU. ARE YOU SURE?
YEAH. GIVE ME MY CAT.
WHAT'S HIS NAME?
UM, BU-- BUTTONS.
BOB BUTTONS?
UH-HUH. BOB BUTTONS.
YOU ARE A VERY BAD MAN.

MONOPOLY.
LOOK AT THAT.
SO, UH...
WHERE DID, UH, PAOLO COME FROM?
UH, ITALY, I THINK.
NO, I MEAN TONIGHT, IN THE BUILDING... SUDDENLY INTO OUR LIVES.
WELL, THAT CAT. THE CAT TURNED OUT TO BE PAOLO'S CAT. ISN'T THAT FUNNY?
THAT-- THAT IS FUNNY AND RACHEL KEEPS TOUCHING HIM.
I LOOKED ALL OVER THE BUILDING AND I COULDN'T FIND THE KITTY ANYWHERE.
I FOUND HIM. IT WAS PAOLO'S CAT.
AH, WELL, THERE YOU GO-- LAST TO KNOW AGAIN.
AND I'M GUESSING SINCE NOBODY TOLD ME THIS IS PAOLO.
OH, PAOLO. THIS IS PHOEBE.
YOU BETCHA.
ALL RIGHT, OKAY. WHAT NEXT?
BLOW A BUBBLE. A BUBBLE'S GOOD.
IT'S GOT A BOYISH CHARM.
IT'S IMPISH.

NICE GOING, IMP.
OKAY, IT'S OKAY. ALL I NEED TO DO IS
REACH OVER AND PUT IT BACK IN MY MOUTH.
GOOD SAVE. WE'RE BACK ON TRACK, AND I'M...
CHEWING SOMEONE ELSE'S GUM.

YES. THANK YOU. THAT WAS...

PERFECTION?
HEY, WHAT DID HE SAY THAT WAS SO FUNNY?
I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA.

MY GOD, YOU GUYS, WHAT AM I DOING?
THIS IS SO UN-ME.
IF YOU WANT, I'LL DO IT.
I KNOW. I JUST WANT TO BITE HIS BOTTOM LIP.
BUT I WON'T.
WHEN HE FIRST SMILED
THOSE THREE SECONDS WERE MORE EXCITING THAN THREE WEEKS IN BERMUDA WITH BARRY.
DID YOU RENT MOPEDS?
'CAUSE I'VE HEARD...
IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW. OKAY.
I KNOW IT'S TOTALLY SUPERFICIAL AND WE HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON
AND WE DON'T EVEN SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE
BUT, GOD!
PAOLO, HI.

SO DO YOU, UM...
OKAY. SO YOU, UH... YOU DO KNOW A LITTLE ENGLISH. POCO. LITTLE.
DO YOU KNOW THE WORD "CRAPWEASEL"?

Ross: THANK YOU. Monica: THANKS.
Ross: KIND OF SPOOKY WITHOUT ANY LIGHTS.
Ross: GUYS, GUYS, I HAVE THE DEFINITIVE ONE.
THIS PROBABLY ISN'T THE BEST TIME TO BRING IT UP
BUT YOU HAVE TO THROW A PARTY FOR MONICA.
WELL, THIS HAS BEEN FUN.
YES, AND THANKS FOR LETTING ME USE YOUR PHONE
AND FOR SAVING MY LIFE.
WELL, GOOD-BYE, CHANDLER.
